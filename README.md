# NLP_Justice
This repository consists of all NLP related learnings on Indian Judicial data.

## Directory Tree:

### [OpenNyAI experiment on POCSO Cases](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/NLP_Justice/tree/main/POCSO)
We selected a sample of 50 POCSO judgements from Assam and checked how OpenNyAI can be used to extract variables from the judgements to perform legal research. This repository has codebooks of this experiment.

### [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/NLP_Justice/tree/main/NER)
NERs are useful for recognising "Entities" in a piece of text. For Court Judgements, these entities could be "STATUTES", "JUDGE NAME" etc. This directory has codebook that experimented various NER Models on Indian judicial texts.

### [Summarization](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/NLP_Justice/tree/main/Summarization)
Summarization Models help in summarizing a piece of text. This directory has codebooks on **extractive summarization** of Indian court judgements using OpenNyAI library.
