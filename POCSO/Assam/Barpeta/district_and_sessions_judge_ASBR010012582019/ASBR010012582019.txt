DISCUSSION, DECISIONS AND REASONS THEREOF :

 

7). To decide the above point and sections of law, let us
examine, analyze and appreciate the evidence of the witnesses
alongwith the relevant documents.

The Victim [P.W.1] has deposed that informant is her
grandmother. At the relevant time, accused went to her house about 3
years ago. She stated that accused pushed her.

She exhibited her statement recorded under Section 164
CrPC before the learned Magistrate as Ext.1 and Ext.1(1), Ext.1(2)
and Ext.1(3) are her signatures. She gave her statement as tutored
by others.

During cross-examination, she stated that she knew
the accused person prior to the incident and he sometime visited her
house. She stated that accused did not do any bad work with
her and just caught her hand and pulled her. She gave her
statement before the Magistrate as told by Police. She stated
that no untoward incident occurred with her by the accused.

8). Rup Bhanu [P.W.2] has deposed in her evidence that
incident took place three year before. On the relevant day, accused
came to her house and pulled hand of the victim. She stated that
accused did not do anything with the victim. Then, she lodged
the case.

During her cross-examination, she stated that no bad
incident took place to her victim grand daughter and the
contents of the FIR was not read out to her. She further stated that
there was an altercation between the accused and the victim on the
date of incident.

9). From a close perusal of the evidence, it is seen from the
statement of the victim (P.W.1), who is star witness of this instant case

Special POCSO 115 of 2019 Page 4 of 7
that accused did not commit any bad work with her and just
caught her hand and pulled her. She stated in her cross-
examination that no untoward incident took place with her and she
gave her statement as tutored by Police.

Moreover, informant namely Rup Bhanu (P.W.2) deposed
almost same story as deposed by P.W.1. She stated that no bad
incident took place to her victim grand daughter and she did not
go through the contents of the FIR. PW.2 further stated that there was
altercation between the accused and the victim on the date of incident.

Thus, from the above evidence, it is crystal clear that the
victim alongwith the informant did not support the alleged incident, as
per prosecution story.

10). Hence, | am constrained to hold that the evidence
adduced by the prosecution in support of its case is nothing shorter
than mere conjectures and suspicion. Consequently, the charge under
Sections 448/376 of IPC read with Section 4 of the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 is held to be not proved
against the accused Mohibul Islam beyond all reasonable doubt.
Accordingly, the accused is found entitled to get benefit of doubt, for
which, the accused Mohibul Islam is acquitted on benefit of
doubt under Sections 448/376 of IPC read with Section 4 of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

11). On scrutiny of the evidence on record, it is seen that no
case has been made out against the accused Mohibul Islam to warrant
his conviction under Sections 448/376 IPC read with Section 4 of
The Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012
beyond all reasonable doubt, for which, | am of the opinion that the
accused is entitled to acquittal on benefit of doubt, which | accordingly
do.

12). In the result, accused Mohibul Islam is acquitted of the
charge under Sections 448/376 IPC read with Section 4 of The

Special POCSO 115 of 2019 Page 5 of 7
Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled
against him, on benefit of doubt.
His bail bond stands discharged.

13). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 22"4
day of July, 2019.
