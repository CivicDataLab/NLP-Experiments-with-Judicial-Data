PM. at Uzirar Char, within the jurisdiction of Alopatichar Police Station
District Barpeta, committed rape on the informant/victim Jarzina Khatun,
aged about 14 years, D/O Ali Akbar, committing penetrative sexual

assault on her ?

Discussion, decision and reasons thereof

 

6. According to the FIR-Ext.1, the alleged occurrence took place
on 28.08.2015 at about 7:00 PM. The FIR was lodged on 04.10.2015 and
the victim was examined by the M.O. on 05.10.2015. The M.O. opined that
“there is no sign detected, there is no injury marks on her private parts.
Victim is not suffering from any physical or mental disability. There is no
foreign body on her cloths/body.”

7. The said victim as PW4 has stated that she is the informant
as well as the victim of this case. On the date of occurrence, her parents
3

were not at home. The cultivation of the accused was damaged by their
cow. Then the accused rebuked her. Then her maternal uncle took her to
the police station. She lodged the FIR-Ext.2. Her statement was recorded
by the Magistrate and Ext.3 is the said statement. M.O. examined her. In
cross examination, she has stated that she does not know by whom the
FIR was written by her maternal uncle. She does not know what was
written in the FIR. The same was not read out to her. As tutored by her
maternal uncle she made the statement before the Magistrate. A quarrel
took place relating to damage of paddy and the accused tied their cow.
The accused person did not do any illicit act with her.

8. PW2-Ali Akbar and PW3- Aimona Khatun are the father and
mother of the victim respectively. Both of them have clearly stated that on
the date of occurrence they were not present at home. Returning home
they came to know that a quarrel took place between the accused and the
victim relating to damage of paddy of the accused by their cow. Then the
maternal uncle of the victim took her to the police station and lodged the
FIR. In fact, only a quarrel took place between the accused and the victim.
The accused did not do any illicit act with her. They do not know as to why
the case was filed by the maternal uncle of the victim.

8. From the above discussions of the evidences of the
prosecution witnesses, it is found that according to the victim, on the very
date of occurrence she was taken by her maternal uncle to the police
station and she lodged the FIR. But the FIR disclosed that the occurrence
took place on 28.08.2015 and the FIR was lodged on 04.10.2015 and the
victim was examined by M.O. on 05.10.2015. So it creates a doubt
regarding the alleged date of occurrence. Furthermore, PW2 & PW3 i.e.
the father and mother of the victim respectively were not present at the
time of occurrence. Both the them have categorically stated that the
accused person did not do any illicit act with the victim. Only a quarrel
took place relating to the damage of paddy by their cow. PW2 & PW3 are
corroborated by the victim/PW4 by saying that on the date of occurrence
4

her parents were not present at home and the accused person rebuked
her as his paddy was damaged by their cow. The accused person did not
do any illicit act with her. She made the statement u/s 164 CrPC as tutored
by her maternal uncle.

9. Under the above facts and circumstances, it is clear that
none of the prosecution witnesses had made a single whisper regarding
the commission of rape by the accused person on the victim. Under such
circumstances, the accused person cannot be held guilty for any offence
either under section 376 I.P.C or under section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012.
Therefore the accused person is acquitted and set at liberty.

10. Bail bond executed by the accused person and the surety are
extended for another period of six months from the date of this judgment
under section 437-A Cr.P.C.

11. Send copy of this Judgment and order to the Hon'ble Gauhati
High Court and also to the District Magistrate, Barpeta under section 365
Cr.P.C.

12. Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 7th day of
May, 2018.

Dictated & corrected by me.
