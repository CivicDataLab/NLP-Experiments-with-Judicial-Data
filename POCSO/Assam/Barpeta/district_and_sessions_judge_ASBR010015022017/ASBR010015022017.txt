Discussion, decision and reasons thereof

 

6. According to the FIR, the accused person tried to commit
rape on the victim on 21.12.2015 at about 3:00 PM. The FIR was lodged
on 22.12.2015, but the victim was produced before the M.O. for
examination on 29.02.2016. However, the victim refused for her physical
examination.

7. The informant Manuruddin as PW1 has deposed that the
occurrence took place about 2/2Â¥% years ago, but prior to the occurrence
3

dispute was going on in between him and the accused. One day at about
4: 00 PM while he was fishing in their pond, the victim was alone at home.
At that time the accused person came to their house. Seeing the accused
the victim started shouting and then he rushed to his house. After 2/3
days of the occurrence he lodged the FIR at the instigation of their
Dewani. Ext.1 is the FIR, but no such occurrence took place as narrated in
the FIR.

8. One independent witness Safura Khatun as PW2 has
deposed that both the accused and informant are her neighbours. She
heard that a quarrel took place in between the accused and the informant.
Except that no such occurrence took place in between them.

9. The victim as PW3 has deposed that a land dispute was
going on between her father and the accused. About 1/2 years ago one
day at afternoon, her father was fishing in their pond. She was alone at
home. At that time the accused came to their house in search of her
father. Then out of fear she started shouting. Her father rushed to the
place of occurrence. Her father rebuked the accused. The accused fled
away. Her father lodged the case. Police produced her before the medical
officer, but she refused to undergo medical examination. Her statement
was recorded by the magistrate.

In cross examination, she has stated that she made
statement before the magistrate as tutored by her father and police. In
fact, no such occurrence took place and she has no objection if the
accused is acquitted.

10. From the above discussions of the evidences of the
prosecution witnesses, it is found that the victim is the vital witness in this
case. Except her no other witness saw the occurrence. But the victim
herself has not supported the case of the FIR. Rather, she has stated that
the accused came to their house in search of her father and she shouted
out of fear. She made the statement before the Magistrate as tutored by
her father and the police. PW1 i.e. the informant/father of the victim and
4

PW2 who is an independent witness, have also supported the version of
PW3 by saying that no such occurrence took place as narrated in the FIR.
Both the them have categorically stated that no such occurrence took
place as narrated in the FIR.

11. Under the above facts and circumstances, it is clear that
none of the prosecution witnesses had made a single whisper regarding
the commission of rape by the accused person on the victim. Under such
circumstances, the accused person cannot be held guilty either under
section 448 IPC or under section 8 of POCSO Act, 2012. Therefore, the
accused person is acquitted and set at liberty.

12. Bail bond executed by the accused person and the surety are
extended for another period of six months from the date of this judgment
under section 437-A Cr.P.C.

13. Send copy of this Judgment and order to the Hon'ble Gauhati
High Court and also to the District Magistrate, Barpeta under section 365
Cr.P.C.

14. Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 13th day
of July, 2018.
