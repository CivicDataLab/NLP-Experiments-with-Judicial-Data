DISCUSSION, DECISIONS AND REASONS THEREOF :

 

7). To decide the above point and sections of law, let us
examine, analyze and appreciate the evidence of the witnesses
alongwith the relevant documents.

The Victim [P.W.1] has deposed that informant is her
father and she knows the accused person. She used to have telephonic
conversation with the accused prior to the incident and had entered
into love affairs with the accused person. On the relevant date,
accused came to her house at night hours and took her to his house.
She stated that accused kept her for one day in his house and on next
day, accused took her to Howly. Accused kept her in the house of one
person. Then, Police caught both of them at night from Rajakhata.

Police sent her to Doctor for her medical examination and
Police got her statement recorded under Section 164 CrPC by learned
Magistrate. She exhibited her statement as Ext.1 and Ext.1(1), 1(2) &
1(3) are her signatures.

In her cross-examination, she stated that she herself
called the accused and went out alongwith him from her house. Then,
public caught both of them.

She admitted her age as 16 years. Her father lodged this
case when he found her missing from her house.

She stated that accused did not force her to go with him.
She gave her statement before learned Magistrate as told by Police.

Special POCSO 35 of 2019 Page 4 of 7
8). Ajmat Ali [P.W.2] deposed in his evidence that he lodged
this case. Victim is his daughter. Incident took place before 1 ¥% years.
He stated that he did not find her victim daughter in his house in the
early morning and searched the victim, but he did not find her. After
that, he lodged this case. On the next day, Police recovered his victim
daughter from Rajakhat. Police informed him.

Then, victim daughter told him that she went the accused
as per her telephonic conversation with the accused.

He exhibited the FIR as Ext.2 and Ext.2(1) is his signature.

In his cross-examination, he stated that he gave the
name of accused out of suspicion in the FIR and nothing happened
more than what he has stated above in his evidence.

9). From a close perusal of the evidence, it is seen from the
evidence of the victim that accused did not kidnap her (P.W.1). She
willingly went out with the accused person from her house. P.W.1
admitted in her evidence that she had love affairs with the accused
person. On the relevant date, she called the accused and went out with
him. Then public caught both of them and handed over her to her
parents.

P.W.1 stated that her father lodged the case when he
found her missing from her house.

Victim girl (PW.1) clearly stated that accused did not force
her to go with him and she gave her statement before learned

Magistrate as told by police.

Thus, it is crystal clear from the version of the victim girl,
that accused did not kidnap the victim girl. This case was lodged with a
false story by her father against the accused person.

Moreover, the informant namely Ajmat Ali (P.W.2) also
deposed in his cross-examination that he gave the name of accused
out of suspicion in the FIR.

Special POCSO 35 of 2019 Page 5 of 7
10). Hence, | am constrained to hold that the evidence
adduced by the prosecution in support of its case is nothing shorter

than mere conjectures and suspicion.

11). Consequently, the charge under Sections 365/366A of
IPC read with Section 4 of the Protection of Children From
Sexual Offences Act, 2012 is held to be not proved against the
accused Jahedul Islam @ Jaidul Ali beyond all reasonable doubt.
Accordingly, the accused is found entitled to get benefit of doubt, for
which, the accused Jahedul Islam @ Jaidul Ali is acquitted on benefit of
doubt under Sections 365/366A of IPC read with Section 4 of the
Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012

12). In the result, accused Jahedul Islam @ Jaidul Ali is
acquitted of the charge under Sections 365/366A of IPC read with
Section 4 of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences
Act, 2012, levelled against him, on benefit of doubt.

His bail bond stand discharged.

13). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 30%
