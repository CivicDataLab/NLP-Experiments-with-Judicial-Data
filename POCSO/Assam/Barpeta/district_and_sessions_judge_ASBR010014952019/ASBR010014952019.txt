DISCUSSION, DECISIONS AND REASONS THEREOF :

7). To decide the above point and sections of law, let us examine,
analyze and appreciate the evidence of the witnesses alongwith the relevant
documents.

Eyaton Nessa [P.W.1] has deposed in her evidence that
informant is her father and she knew the accused person. She stated that
incident took place before 2 years. On the relevant day, at about 8 PM, she went
to the house of accused to bring one book from his sister and stayed there for
2/3 hours. She further stated that the house of accused is just on the backside of
her house. Her mother started shouting when she did not find her in her
residence. Then, parents of the accused brought her to her house at about 11
PM.

Then, People of society also quarreled with her mother as to why
she (P.W.1) went to the house of accused, at late night. She deposed that her
father came in the morning and lodged this case.

P.W.1 stated that police examined her and sent her for her
medical examination and also got her statement recorded under Section 164
CrPC by the learned Magistrate.

She exhibited her statement recorded under Section 164 CrPC as
Ext.1 and Ext.1(1) & 1(2) are her signatures.

During her cross-examination, she stated that she gave her
statement before the learned Magistrate as tutored by the villagers. She deposed

that no incident took place with her.

8). Sabur Ali [P.W.2] deposed in his evidence that he had lodged
the ejahar and he knew the accused person. Victim is his daughter. He stated
that incident took place before 2 years. At the time incident, he was at Guwahati.
His wife informed him over phone that his victim daughter went to the house of
accused. On coming home, his wife and villagers told him about the incident.

Then, he lodged the case against the accused alleging rape on being asked by

Special POCSO 140 of 2019 Page4 of 7
the villagers. He found his victim daughter at his home. After that, accused was
arrested by police.

P.W.2 stated that he did not ask anything to his victim daughter.
He did not know as to whether police asked his victim daughter or not.

In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not know the
contents of the ejahar and the same was written by villagers and he put his
thumb impression thereon. He further stated that the ejahar was lodged after

delay of 3 days.

9). From a close perusal of the evidence, it is seen from the statement
of the victim (P.W.1), who is star witness of this instant case that deposed in her
evidence that on the day of alleged incident, she went to the house of accused to
bring one book from his sister and stayed there for 2/3 hours. After that, her
mother raised shouting as she did not find her daughter. Then, parents of the
accused brought her to her house at about 11 PM. In the meantime, villagers
quarreled with her mother as to why she went to the house of accused at late
night and her father lodged this case.

But the victim girl clearly stated in her cross-examination that no
incident took place with her as alleged in the FIR and clearly stated that she gave
her statement before the learned Magistrate as tutored by the villagers.

Thus, it is clearly indicated that victim girl went to the
house of accused person voluntarily as she did not make any hue and
cry in the said house. Her conduct clearly shows that the alleging incident
narrated in the FIR is totally false.

Moreover, her father who is the informant of this case did not
know the content of the FIR as stayed by him in his cross-examination.

The conduct of victim clearly shows that she was a willing party
and she voluntarily went with the accused at the time of incident. The conduct of
the victim is not found natural had she been abducted or kidnapped by the
accused person by force.

There is no material on record to hold that the accused
kidnapped and committed rape on the victim, to constitute offence
under Sections 365/376/506 IPC read with Section 4 of the Protection

Special POCSO 140 of 2019 PageS of 7
of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

10). To bring home the guilt of the accused under Section
365/376/506 of IPC read with Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012, it is necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused
induced the prosecutrix or compelled her by force to go from any place; that
such inducement was by deceitful means; that such kidnapping or abduction took
place with the intent that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit intercourse and/or
that the accused knew it to be likely that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit

intercourse, as a result of her abduction or kidnapping.

11). However, from to discussion made herein above, it is crystal clear
that victim went to the house of accused person voluntarily. There is no evidence
of inducement or threat to the victim at the relevant time of incident.

12). On scrutinizing the evidence on record, considering the entire
aspect of the matter and evidence, produced by the prosecution, I am of the
considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish that the accused
kidnapped the victim and committed rape on her. Hence, accused is entitled to

acquittal under the benefit of doubt, which I accordingly do.

13). In the result, accused Firoj Ali Sikder is acquitted of the charge
under section 365/376/506 of IPC read with Section 4 of Protection of Children
from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him, on benefit of doubt.

The bail bond stands discharged.

14). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 11% day of
September, 2019.
