By this order, I am going to dispose the petition bearing petition no. 433/19 dated 03.04.2019, filed by the Ld. Counsel for defence claiming the accused Manowar Hussain to be juvenile. Perused and considered the materials on record. I have also heard and considered the submissions put forwarded by the Ld. Special PP for state as well as Ld. Counsel for defence claiming the accused to be juvenile.I have also gone through the deposition of CW-1 Sri Madan Chandra Mondal, the Head Teacher of Dakhin Chotoborjana L.P School, who issued school certificate of the accused Manowar Hussain, which was exhibited by Ext. A and Ext. A(1) is the signature of CW-1. I have also gone through the relevant register along with the school certificate of Manowar Hussain issued by the Head Teacher of Dakhin Chotoborjana L.P School. After perusing and considering all the relevant register, school certificate of accused Manowar Hussain along with evidence of CW-1 Sri Madan Ch. Mondal, the Head Teacher of Dakhin Chotoborjana L.P School, it appears that the date of birth of the accused Manowar Hussain at the time of his admission neither recorded in admission register on the basis of the birth certificate of accused Manowar Hussain nor CW-1 make it clear on what basis the date of birth of the accused Manowar Hussain has been written in the admission register to be 18.10.2007 at the time of his admission. In my considered view it is not safe to hold the accused to be a juvenile on the basis of a school certificate issued by the school authority, who itself is not clear and certain on what basis the date of birth of its student i.e. accused Manowar Hussain was recorded in the admission register to be 18.10.2007. It also appears that the date of birth of accused Manowar Hussain in the admission register was neither recoded on the basis of his birth certificate nor on the information given by the parents of the accused Manowar Hussain. Accordingly, the claim of the Ld. Counsel for the petitioner that the accused Manowar Hussain at the time of occurrence was juvenile appears to be not sustainable and hence rejected.Return all the relevant documents  to the school authority on condition that the school authority shall keep all the relevant register as exhibited in this case intact as on today, not to make any altercation or any tampering in the writing of the register in safe custody with further condition that the school authority shall produce the same, if necessary in connection with this case.Inform all concerned accordingly.

Perused the case record. Seen the copy of letter issued by  the Supdt. Cum Chairman of the Medical board from which it reveals that as per order dated 05.07.2019 a medical board has been constituted and the meeting of the board has already held on 17.07.2019 at 10 A.M. in the Office of the Supdt. of Bongaigaon Civil Hospital in connection with a medical and ossification test of accused Monowar Hussain as per order under reference. It also appeared that the board consists of 4 (four) members i.e. doctors namely Dr. P. K. Debnath (MS), Dr. D.S. Ray (ENT), Dr. J.K. Boro (Ortho), Dr. Mrs. D. Choudhury (Dentist). The opinion of the board is not yet received by the authority concerned. Issue reminder accordingly. Remand back the accused person to the jail hajot.            Fixing 02.08.2019 for production and report.           Seen the bail petition filed  by the  learned counsel  for defence seeking  bail for the  above named accused person.            Perused and considered the materials on record.  Heard  and   considered the submission put forwarded by the learned Addl. P.P for the State as well as learned counsel for defence seeking bail for the accused person. After perusing the materials on record, it appears that in this case the charge-sheet has already been submitted against the accused person and hence in my considered view the enlargement of the accused person on bail at this stage will in no way hamper the pace of investigation as the investigation of this case has already been completed. That apart  the accused person  also appeared to be a local person, which minimize the chance fleeding from justice. It also appeared that the accused person has been arrested on 18.03.2019 and since then he has been in jail hajot for a period of more than 4 (four) months.         Considering all this factors  as well as to provide an opportunity to the accused person to face free trial and to prepare his defence, I feel inclined to grant the privilege of bail in favour of the above named accused person. Accordingly, the accused above named is allowed to go on bail on Rs. 15,000/- (Rupees fifteen thousand) with a surety of like amount on condition that the accused person1. shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of this court without prior written permission of the court,2. shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted to the fact of the case so as to dissuade him or her from disclosing such facts to the court during the course of trial, and          In case violation of any one of the aforesaid conditions, the privilege of bail as granted in favour of above named accused shall automatically cancelled.
