The Judgment is pronounced and delivered in the open court. The Judgment is prepared in the separate sheets.             In the result, I find the accused Shri Duta Sing Difusa guilty under section 8 of the POCSO Act and accordingly he is convicted.           On the point of sentence, the accused person is heard and to that effect his statement is recorded.           It has been submitted by the learned lawyer appearing on behalf of the accused person that there is no evidence on record showing that the accused was earlier convicted by the Court of Law and as such the accused deserves to be punished leniently. On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that the accused needs to be punished exemplary failing which a negative message will go to the Society. Considering age of the accused person and nature of the offence, I am of the opinion that the accused deserves to be punished leniently.
