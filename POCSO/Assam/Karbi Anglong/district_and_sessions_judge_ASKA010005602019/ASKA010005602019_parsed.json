Having very carefully gone through the submissions duly advanced by the learned lawyers of the both sides as well as case diary I find that there is a ground for presuming that the accused committed the offence under section 8 of the POCSO Act and accordingly charge is framed. The particular of the offence charged is duly read over and explained to the accused person to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.           I already heard learned lawyers of the both sides on the petition vide petition No. 2230/2019 wherein accused Sahidul has prayed for allowing him to take custody of the vehicle bearing Registration No. AS 09 G 3023, chasis No. MA1XL2WJXK6E26506, Engine No. WJK6E37599, Model- Mahindra Bolero Power on the ground stated therein supported by an affidavit.           Upon perusal of the seizure list it appears that in connection with this case aforesaid vehicle was seized. It also appears that charge sheet has been submitted against the accused/petitioner and as such it can be said that for the purpose of the investigation the seized vehicle will not be required. Upon perusal of the RC and insurance certificate it appears that accused/petitioner is the registered owner of the aforesaid seized vehicle.          Under the above facts and circumstances, the prayer is allowed. Accordingly the accused/petitioner is allowed to take custody of the aforesaid seized vehicle on execution of a bond of Rs. 5,00,000/-.", "Next Purpose": "Evidence", "Next Hearing Date": "29-11-2019"}}, {"Judge": "District and Session Judge", "Business On Date": "29-11-2019", "Hearing Date": "07-02-2020", "Purpose of hearing": "Evidence", "business_details": {"Presentee": ["State of Assam", "PP", "Sahidul Islam"], "Business": "accused present.PWs absent. summon not returned.
