house and gagged the mouth of her minor daughter, the victim ‘X’ (name

POCSO Case No. 41/2017 Page 1 of 5
withheld) aged 10 years while she was sleeping on the bed. On the hue and cry
of the victim, the informant and others rushed there and found the accused
lying under the bed. They took out the accused and handed over him to the
police.
2. On receipt of the FIR, Morigaon PS Case No. 21/2017 u/s 448/354
IPC r/w Section 3/4 of the POCSO Act, 2012 was registered and investigated
into. During investigation, the victim was medically examined and on
completion of investigation, the Investigating Officer (i/o) submitted charge
sheet against the accused Sri Kamal Nath for trial u/s 448/354 IPC r/w Section
3/4 of the POCSO Act, 2012.
3. It may be mentioned herein that during investigation, on
12.01.2017, the accused was arrested and vide order dated 08.02.2017, he was
allowed to go on bail. However, due to jumping bail, accused was again
arrested and produced before the Court on 01.09.2018, and was remanded to
judicial custody till 07.02.2019.
4. On 23.10.2017, charge sheet was laid before this Court and vide
order dated 06.02.2018, charges u/s 448/354 IPC r/w Section 8 of the POCSO
Act, 2012 were framed and explained to the accused to which he pleaded not
guilty.
5. During trial, prosecution side has examined only three witnesses
i.e. the Medical Officer, informant and the victim. Considering the nature of the
evidence of the witnesses (PW-1 to PW-3), examination of accused u/s 313
Cr.P.C is dispenses with and I proposed to dispose the case by using powers
u/s 232 Cr.P.C. without calling the accused to enter into defence.
6. I have heard argument of Id. Special P.P. Mr. A. Kalam and Mr. N.
U. Ahmed, learned Legal Aid Counsel and gone through the evidence on record.
I have considered the submission of both the sides.

POINTS FOR DETERMINATION ARE:

7 @& Whether on 11.01.2017 the accused committed house trespass by
entering into the residence of the informant and remained there illegally?
(II) Whether on 11.01.2017, the victim 'X' was subjected to sexual
assault/subjected to outraging modesty by the accused ?

DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

8. PW-1, Dr. N. Ahmed, the Medical Officer deposed in her evidence
that on 12.01.2017, she examined the victim ‘xX’ in connection with Morigaon PS
Case No. 21/2017. And found that there was no injury in the private parts of
the victim *X’ and there was also no any external injury except mild neck pain.
She exhibited the Medical Report as Ext. 1 and her signature thereon as Ext.
1(1). Defence declined to cross-examine.

9. PW-2, the victim ‘X’ deposed in her evidence that presently she is
aged about 13 years. On 11.01.2017, at about 9:30 — 10:00 PM, while she was
Sleeping in her room, on hearing some noise under her bed, she looked and
saw that one boy was sleeping under the bad. On her hue and cry, her parents
came there and her father pulled out the boy. Then the matter was informed to
police who came there and took away the boy to the police station. On the next
day, police took her to the hospital. She could recognize that accused as the
boy found under her bed. In her cross-examination by defence, she stated that
there was dark inside the room. Initially she could not recognize the boy. She
stated that there was hue and cry on their courtyard and a boy was lying there
under intoxication. He was handed over to police. She denied the defence
suggestion that the accused did not enter inside her house and was not
brought out from her house.

10. PW-3, Smti. M. Barman, the mother of the victim ‘X’ as well as the
informant of the case deposed in her evidence that, the date of birth of the
victim is 15.07.2007. Presently she is a student of Class- VII. On 11.01.2017, at
about 9:30 — 10:00 PM, while the victim ‘X’ was sleeping in her room, on
hearing some noise under her bed she called her to her room and on going
there, they saw that one person was hiding under her bed. Thereafter, her
husband pulled him out from the bed and on scolding him, neighbours
gathered there. The matter was informed to police who came and brought the
boy to the police station. On the next day, she lodged the FIR at the Morigaon
Police Station. She proved the FIR as Ext. 2. She also recognize that accused is

the boy found under the bed of her daughter. In cross-examination, she denied

POCSO Case No. 41/2017 Page 3 of 5
defence suggestion that she deposed falsely that the accused was found under
the bed of her daughter. She stated that on apprehension of the accused, she
felt that he was under intoxication and he is a resident of distant village. She
also denied the suggestion that while the accused was going under
intoxication, he lied in front of their courtyard and for this, they handed over
him to police. She admitted that on the suggestion of villagers, the accused
was handed over to police and as asked by police, she had lodged the FIR. She
further stated that they have already compromised the matter with the accused
and she has no objection in acquittal of the accused.

11. From the above evidence on record, let me decide the points
formulated. So far age of the victim is concerned, the victim and the informant
claimed that at the time of incident, the victim was aged about 13 years. This
fact remained unrebutted during cross-examination by defence.

12. From the evidence of the PW-2 the victim, it appears that she
deposed nothing against the accused involving him with the alleged offence of
outraging her modesty or committing sexual assault upon her. The victim in her
evidence-in-chief clearly stated that on 11.01.2017, at about 9:30 — 10:00 PM,
while she was sleeping in her room, on hearing some noise under her bed, she
looked and saw that one boy was sleeping under the bad. On her hue and cry,
her parents came there and her father pulled out the boy. This part of evidence
was supported by PW 3. Though in the FIR, allegation was made regarding
gagging of the mouth of her the victim, but during evidence, she did not utter a
single word regarding sexual assault or molestation of the victim by the
accused. The allegation of sexual assault/outraging modesty of the victim is not
proved.

13. So far the charge of house trespass is concerned, from the
evidence of PW 2 and 3 categorically deposed that on hearing the noise under
the bed, victim raised alarm and on this, PW 3 and her went there and pulled
out from under the bed. Both PW 2 and 3 identified the accused as the persons
found under bed. They denied the defence suggestion that accused being

under influence of intoxication, fall down infront of the house of informant and

POCSO Case No. 41/2017 Page 4 of 5
was handed over to police. The evidence of PW 2 and 3 so far house trespass
is concerned remained unshaken and found reliable and trustworthy.

14. At this it may be mentioned here that the offence u/s 448 IPC as
proved by prosecution is compoundable u/s 320 Cr.P.C by the owner of the
house. PW 3, the owner of the house, in her cross-examination admitted that
they have already compromised the matter with the accused and she has no
objection in acquittal of the accused. Thus this compromise by the informant
amount to compounding of the offence u/s 448 IPC.

15. Considering the evidence as discussed above, it clear that there is
nothing in the evidence of PW-2 and PW-3 against the accused for the alleged
offence of outraging modesty and sexual assault as made punishable u/s 354
IPC and Section 8 of the POCSO Act, 2012 and though offence u/s 448 IPC is
found to be proved by the prosecution but as the same is compoundable and
the PW 3 has compromised the matter with accused, accused cannot be held
guilty for the said offence and he deserves acquittal on this count.

16. Considering above discussion, accused Kamal Nath is acquitted
from the charges U/S 448/354 IPC and Section 8 of the POCSO Act, 2012 and
set at liberty forthwith.

17. The bail bond executed by accused and his surety are extended
for another six months from today u/s 437-A Cr.P.C.

18. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to
DLSA for granting compensation u/s 357-A Cr.P.C.

19. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Morigaon u/s 365 Cr.P.C.

20. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on
contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 14 day of
February, 2020 at Morigaon.
