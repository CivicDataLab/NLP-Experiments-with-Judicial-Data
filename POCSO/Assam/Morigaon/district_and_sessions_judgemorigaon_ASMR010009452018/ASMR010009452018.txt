registered under section 363 IPC and subsequently, 376 IPC was added, which after
investigation resulted in a charge-sheet against the present accused U/s 376 IPC r/w

the learned counsels, charge was framed vide order dated 12.11.2018 against the said

DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

4. Heard learned Public Prosecutor for the State and the learned defence counsel

 

Mr. A. Salam, appearing for the accused person. I have perused the evidence and
other relevant materials on record and also considered the submissions of learned

counsels.

5. PW-1 is the prosecutrix and she has stated in her deposition that the
informant is her mother and that the accused was a neighbouring person. She further
stated that at the time of the incident, her age was 18 2 years and that she was
having a love affair with the accused, pursuant to which she eloped with him, but her
parents did not agree with her relationship and her mother lodged the instant case
against the accused, where after the police brought her back home. She further stated
that subsequently she got married to another person. The prosecutrix stated in her
deposition that after lodging of the case, the police had taken her to the Doctor for
medical examination and also before the Magistrate for recording her statement. She
proved that statement as Exhibit 1 and her signature thereon as Exhibit 1 (1). In
cross-examination, the prosecutrix stated that she eloped with the accused voluntarily

out of her own will and that the accused did not commit any offence upon her.

6. PW-2 Aklima Begum stated in her deposition that she is the informant of the
case and that the prosecutrix is her daughter and that she also knew the accused
person, who was a neighbourhood person. She further stated in her deposition that at
the time of the incident the age of the prosecutrix was 18 2 years and that she was
having a love affair with the accused since her school days and pursuant to such love

affair, she eloped with him. She further stated that on the day of the incident the
prosecutrix went missing and upon coming to know that she had eloped with the
accused, this witness lodged the instant case upon the accused. She proved as Exhibit
2, the ejahar lodged by her, when she put her thumb impression. She further stated
that subsequently the police recovered the prosecutrix and handed her over to them
and that subsequently, the marriage of the prosecutrix was finalized with another

person. This witness was not cross-examined by the learned defence.

7. Both the prosecutrix-PW-1 and the informant- PW-2 have stated in their
testimonies as narrated above that at the time of incident, the prosecutrix was aged
18 2 years. As already mentioned, PW-2 is also the mother of the prosecutrix. Apart
from the above, PW-2 has stated that the prosecutrix eloped with the accused
pursuant to her love affair. The prosecutrix herself has also stated about having love
affair and having eloped with the accused pursuant to love affair and since her parents
did not agree with their relationship, therefore, the case was lodged. In the cross-
examination of PW-1, it is categorically stated about voluntary elopement with the

accused and she also stated that the accused did not commit any offence upon her.

8. On the basis of the aforesaid evidence, the ingredients of Section 4 of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, with which the
accused has been charged with in this trial and/or any other minor offence, are not

made out.

9. Consequently, the prosecution case fails due to lack of evidence and the

accused is entitled to be acquitted.

accused Md. Ashad Ali @ Arshad Ali @ Kabiraj stands acquitted. The accused, if in
