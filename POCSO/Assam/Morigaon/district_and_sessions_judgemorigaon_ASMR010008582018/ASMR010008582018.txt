DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

4. Heard learned public prosecutor for the State and learned defence counsel for

 

the accused person. Perused all the relevant materials from the record.

5. Section 363 IPC punishes the act of kidnapping a minor from lawful
guardianship. Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012,
punishes the offence of penetrative sexual assault committed upon a child i.e. person

below 18 years.

6. In this case, the prosecutrix adduced her evidence as PW-2 and the informant
who is the elder brother of the prosecutrix has adduced evidence as PW-1. Both of
them were cross-examined and discharged. The accused is the cousin brother of the
prosecutrix. The informant /PW-1 stated in his evidence that at the time of the
incident, the prosecutrix was aged 18 years. The prosecutrix/PW-2 also stated in her
evidence that her age at the time of the incident was 18 years. Section 2 of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 defines that to prosecute any
person under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, the victim
should be below 18 years. Therefore, on the basis of evidence of the aforesaid
informant and prosecutrix and the age of the prosecutrix at the time of the alleged
incident, charge under Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences

Act, 2012 falls through and the accused is entitled to be acquitted of the said charge.

7. The informant/PW-1 stated in his evidence that he lodged the instant case
thinking that his sister/prosecutrix was missing though she had actually gone to visit a
Mela at Sivsagar along with her friends and the accused. In his cross-examination,
PW-1/informant stated that the case was lodged out of misunderstanding and that the

accused is innocent.

8. The prosecutrix/PW-2 also stated in her evidence that at the time of the

alleged incident, she along with her three female friends had gone to visit a Mela at
Sivsagar. In her cross-examination, the prosecutrix has stated that the accused is

innocent.

9. On the basis of the aforesaid evidence-on-record, ingredients of kidnapping
from the lawful guardianship does not exist and the charge under Section 363 IPC also

falls through, thereby, entitling the accused to be acquitted.

10. Consequently, the prosecution case fails due to lack of any evidence and the

accused is entitled to be acquitted.

case, the accused Md. Julfikar Ali @ Julfikar Ali Bhattu stands acquitted. He shall be
