an ejahar with North Lakhimpur Police Station to the effect that the
victim X is his minor daughter, who has been reading in class-Vl. On

Contd...
2 Special (POCSO) Case No.9/ 2016.

24.03.2014 at about 3 pm when his daughter victim X was coming to
his house from the school, at that time, on the way, the accused, Md.
Rekibur Ali took his daughter victim X into the house of his niece at
village Borbeel and committed rape upon her person. While the
accused was committing rape upon the victim X, a woman of the
house of the niece of the accused made video recording of the scene
and thereafter, published the video in the social media.

2. On receiving the ejahar, the Officer-in-charge of
North Lakhimpur Police Station registered a case vide North Lakhimpur
PS. Case No.254/2014 under Sections 342/ 354D(ii) IPC and under
Section 4 of the POCSO Act.

3. The police started the investigation of the case.
In course of investigation, the I.0. visited the place of occurrence,
prepared sketch map of the place of occurrence and recorded the
statements of the witnesses u/s 161 CrPC. The victim X was forwarded
to the court for recording her statement u/s 164 CrPC, and accordingly,
her statement got recorded u/s 164 CrPC in the court. The 1.0. arrested
the accused, Md. Rekibur Ali on 19.08.2018 and forwarded him before
the court. From the case record, it is found that the other accused,
Musstt. Halima Begum was granted Pre-arrest bail by the then Sessions
Judge, Lakhimpur, North Lakhimpur. After completion of the
investigation on being found sufficient incriminating materials against
the both accused, Md. Rekibur Ali and Musstt. Halima Begum under
Sections 342/ 354 (D) (ii) IPC and u/s 11 of the POCSO Act, the 1.0.
submitted the charge-sheet against the both accused, Md. Rekibur Ali
and Musstt. Halima Begum under Sections 342/ 354 (D) (ii) IPC and u/s
11 of the POCSO Act.

copies were furnished to them. After hearing the learned advocates of
both sides and perusing the case record, my learned predecessor on

being found sufficient materials against the both accused persons
under Sections 342/ 354 (D) (ii)/ 34 IPC and u/s 12 of the POCSO Act in
the case record, the charges under Sections under Sections 342/ 354
(D) (ii)/ 34 IPC and u/s 12 of the POCSO Act had been framed against
the both accused, Md. Rekibur Ali and Musstt. Halima Begum. The
charges were read over and explained to the both accused persons, to
which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

5. In course of trial, the prosecution side examined

7 (Seven) witnesses.

6. The recording of the statement of the both
accused persons u/s 313 CrPC is felt not necessary as because the
prosecution witnesses examined have not implicated the both accused

person in their evidence regarding commission of any offence.

7. The both accused persons denied to adduce any
evidence in their defence.

8. Heard Argument from the learned advocates of
both sides.

9. Perused the case record and the evidence
adduced by the prosecution witnesses in the case very carefully.

10. The points for determination in this case are :

(1) Whether the both accused, Md. Rekibur Ali and
Musstt. Halima Begum on 24.03.2014 at about 3 pm in furtherance of
their common intention wrongfully confined the victim X, a minor girl in
the house of the accused, Musstt. Halima Begum at Borbeel under
North Lakhimpur P.S. ?

Contd...

(Il) Whether the both accused persons in
furtherance of their common intention after confining the victim X, a
minor girl in the house of the accused, Musstt. Halima Begum
committed the offence of stalking?

(Ill) Whether the accused, Md. Rekibur Ali after
wrongfully confining the victim X committed sexual harassment upon
the victim X?

11. DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

The prosecution side examined 7 (seven) witnesses.
PW.1, Md. Hanif Ali is the informant as well as father of the victim X.
According to his evidence, the occurrence had taken place about 2
years back. At the time of occurrence, his daughter victim X was
reading in class-VII and she was of 16 years old. PW.1 in his evidence
also stated that he came to know that his daughter victim X and the
accused, Md. Rekibur Ali were in love and the accused, Md. Rekibur Ali
took snap of his daughter in the house of the accused. The victim X
used to visit the house of the accused. He also stated that he had
lodged the case against the accused as the accused clicked photos of
his daughter. From his evidence, it is found that his daughter victim X
used to visit the house of the accused. From his evidence, it is also
found that there was love affairs between the accused, Md. Rekibur Ali
and the victim X, and the accused clicked a photo of the victim X.

On a careful scrutiny of the evidence of PW.1, the
informant as well as father of the victim X, | do not find any
incriminating material in his evidence against the accused persons for

committing any offence.

PW.2, the victim X in her evidence stated that the
occurrence had taken place about 2 /3 years back. She also stated that
on the date of occurrence, she had not gone to the school. She in her

evidence also stated that she clicked a photo with the accused in the
paddy field near her house. She further stated that she did not inform
the matter to her father. Thereafter, her father lodged the case against
the accused, Musstt. Halima Begum and Md. Rekibur Ali, who is her
distant relative and she has visiting terms with the accused.

This is the evidence adduced by PW.2, the victim X.
On a careful scrutiny of her evidence, | do not find any incriminating
material in her evidence against the accused persons for committing

any offence.

PW.3, Musstt. Anwara Begum is the mother of the
victim X. She in her evidence stated that at the time of occurrence, she
was suffering from illness. She also stated that the accused, Md.
Rekibur Ali and her daughter victim X had clicked a photograph.

This is the evidence adduced by PW.3, Musstt.
Anwara Begum. There is no any material in her evidence against the
accused persons for committing any offence.

PW.4, Md. Babul Ali, PW.5, Musstt. Firoja Begum,
PW.6, Md. Jehirul Islam and PW.7, Abdul Subhan in their evidence did
not implicate the accused persons regarding commission of any
offence.

12. Because of what have been discussed and
pointed out here-in-above, it is appeared that the prosecution side has
totally failed to prove the charges under Sections 342/ 354 (D) (ii)/ 34
IPC brought against the both accused, Md. Rekibur Ali and Musstt.
Halima Begum, and under Section 12 of the POCSO Act brought
against the accused, Md. Rekibur Ali. The both accused persons
deserve to be acquitted.

Ali and Musstt. Halima Begum not guilty and acquit them from the
charges under Sections 342/ 354 (D) (ii)/ 34 IPC, and | also hold the
accused, Md. Rekibur Ali not guilty and acquit him from the charge
under Section 12 of the POCSO Act. The both accused persons are set
at their liberty forthwith.
