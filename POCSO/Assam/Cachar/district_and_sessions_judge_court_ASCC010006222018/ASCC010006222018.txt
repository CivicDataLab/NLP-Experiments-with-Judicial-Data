DECISION, DISCUSSION AND REASONS THEREOF:

6. Let me go through the evidence on record in order to decide as
to whether prosecution is able to prove the charges against the accused

beyond all reasonable doubt.

7. P.W. 1 Safique Uddin, the informant, has stated that he
knew the accused Sahab Uddin About 4/5 months ago the occurrence took
place. At the time of occurrence his daughter Monowara was a student of
class IX in Dholai BNP High School. On the date of occurrence while
Monowara was coming back from the school at 2 P.M. by an autorickshaw
of the accused, the accused then took Monowara through bypass road.
Then police informed him to go to Ranghirkari TOP. Then he went to
Rangirkhari TOP and found his daughter Monowara Begum and the
accused therein in the outpost. Being asked Monowara told him that the
people of the Saidpur bypass locality caught the accused and handed him
over to police. At the time of occurrence, the age of Monowara Begum was

14 years. Police produced Monowara in the Silchar Court wherein
Page 4 of 6
Spl POCSO 13 of 2018
Magistrate recorded her statement and police sent Monowara to SMCH for

her medical examination and she was medically examined therein.

This PW 1 during cross examination has stated that the ejahar was
written by one scribe as per instruction of police. Police asked him to put
his signature in the ejahar and he put his signature accordingly. The FIR
was not read over to him. There was a quarrel between the accused Sab
Uddin and another auto driver at the time of retruning but he did not know
the said auto driver. His daughter reported him that the auto driver and his
men produced the present accused and his daughter to the police station.

His nephew .i.e. the present accused did not do any harm to his daughter.

8. PW 2 Monowara Begum, the victim, has stated that the accused
is her cousin brother. The occurrence took place about four months ago
and at that time, she was a student of Class IX in BNP School, Chowrangi,
Dholai. On the day of occurrence, at the time of returning from school, she
saw the accused coming in an auto and as the accused is her cousin
brother so she came in his auto as passenger. Near the bypass, some
people had assaulted the accused and also detained his auto. They also
informed police. Police came and took her and the accused along with the
auto to the police station. Police had informed her father who had lodged
an FIR. She was also taken to SMCH, Silchar wherein, the doctor medically
examined her. She was also taken to the Court wherein her statement U/S
164 Cr.P.C. was recorded. After that the Court gave her to the zimma of
her father. During cross examination, the victim has stated that she usually
used to go in the auto-rickshaw of the accused as he is her cousin brother.
On the date of occurrence, some people had made hue and cry and
assaulted the accused. The accused has not committed any illegalities

upon her. She has no grievances against the accused.

9. From the above evidence on record, it is found that the victim,
the PW 2 and her father, the informant .i.e. the PW 1, have not supported
the prosecution story and also not implicated the accused person in respect

of the charged offence.

10. So from the above discussions of the evidence on record it is
found that the prosecution has failed to prove the offences U/S 366/354 IPC
R/W_ Section 8 of POCSO Act against the accused beyond all reasonable
doubt. Therefore, the accused Sab Uddin Sheikh @ Sab Uddin stands
acquitted of the charge and he is set at liberty forthwith.

11. Judgment is delivered in the open Court on this 12" Day of
December 2018.
