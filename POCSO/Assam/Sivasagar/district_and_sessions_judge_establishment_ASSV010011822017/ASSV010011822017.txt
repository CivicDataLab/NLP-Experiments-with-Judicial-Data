8) The P.W.1 Ajoy Bhumij is the informant. In the course of trial he exhibited the

accused is his neigbour and the victim girl who is aged about 15 years is his niece. He

When the victim refused to do so, the accused scolded her uttering filthy language. He
stated that at the time of incident he was present there and after seeing the incident he
lodged the FIR. But the PW-1 did not disclose what obscene words were uttered by the

accused.

In cross examination PW-1 admitted that at the time of incident he was at some

misbehave his niece. Only quarrel took place in connection with blocking of the drain.

9) The P.W.2 is the minor victim. She stated that the accused is her neighbour and

her signatures.

In cross-examination PW-2 stated that on the day of occurrence someone had
blocked his drain due to which the accused and his family members faced trouble. She
stated that the accused asked her to move the tap to the other direction. She admitted
that the accused did not assault her physically. She stated that the accused only
removed her hand from the water tap. The PW-2 clearly stated that the accused did not
misbehave her in any manner. Thereafter an altercation took place in between the
informant and the accused. She stated that later on they amicably settled the matter in

the village and has got no objection if the accused is acquitted from the case.

10) The P.W.3 who is the mother of the victim stated in her evidence that on
08.10.2017 at about 5.00 a.m. her daughter had gone to collect water from the govt.
water supply tap and at that time the accused abused her daughter and showed his
private parts to her daughter by removing his clothes. She stated that thereafter
villagers gathered and hearing noise she went to the place of occurrence and came to

12) The P.W.5 Anil Chowra stated in his evidence that the accused and the victim girl
are known to him. He stated that he came to know that a quarrel took place while the

victim went to collect water from the water supply tap.

13) The P.W.6 Hemanta Chowra stated in his evidence that he came to know that a
quarrel took place in between the informant end the accused in connection with

collecting water from the tap.

14) |The PW-7 SI Nurtaz Ali in his evidence stated that on 09.10.2017 he was posted
at Nazira police station. He had investigated the case and submitted charge sheet
against the accused u/s. 323 of IPC and section 12 of POCSO Act. The PW-7 exhibited
sketch map marked as Ext. 6, the medical report of the victim collected by him which is
marked as Ext.7, the medical report of Ajoy Bhumij marked as Ext. 8 and the charge

sheet marked as Ext.9 wherein Ext. 9(1) is his signature.

15) From perusal of the evidence available on record it appears that though in the
FIR some serious allegations were levelled against the accused but during evidence of
PW-1 who is the informant-cum- one of the victim of the alleged incident stated that a
quarrel took place in connection with blocking of a drain. The PW-1 remained totally
silent about any physical assault inflicted upon him by the accused. The PW-2 who is
other victim in her evidence simply stated that the accused had touched her hand and
moved the direction of the tap to other side. She clearly stated that the accused did not
misbehave her in any manner. The PW-3 adduced some implicating evidence against
the accused but she was not supported by the PW-1 and PW-2. The other prosecution

witnesses simply stated that a quarrel took place while the victim was collecting water.

16) Therefore, from the evidence on record on record it is clear that the prosecution
side has failed to establish the case against the accused. Accordingly the accused is held

not guilty and he is acquitted and set at liberty forthwith.

(17) The bail bond of the accused is extended for a period of 6(six) months from

today.

Given under my hand and seal of this court on this 07" day of June, 2019.
