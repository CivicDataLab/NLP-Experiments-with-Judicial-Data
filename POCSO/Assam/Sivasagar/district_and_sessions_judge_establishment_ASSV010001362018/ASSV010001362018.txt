Spl. (P) Case No. 06/2018 Page 2 of 5
(Il) Whether on 15.03.2015 and thereafter, the victim 'M' was

subjected to penetrative sexual assault by the accused?
DECI SION AND REASONS THEREOF

8. PW - 1 Sri Parashuram Rabidas, father of the victim M in his
evidence deposed that his daughter eloped with the accused without informing
me. Due to non-finding her after 3 days he lodged FIR at Namtola PS. Police
recovered his daughter from Bimalapur and handed over to him. On his asking,
victim has stated that having love affairs with the accused, she eloped with the
accused and stated her willingness to stay with Paklu Gowalla. He consented to
their relation. Presently victim is living at the residence of accused as wife and
husband and have one child. In his cross-examination he admitted that he
lodged the FIR on suspicion of kidnap by accused due to her missing. He did
not want to prosecute this case any further and has no objection in acquittal of

the accused from this case.

9. PW-2 the victim M in her evidence deposed that her present age
is about 21 years. Having love affairs with accused Poklu Gowalla, 15.03.2015
as pre-planed, she eloped with him and performed marriage at Tingali bam
Mandir and started living with the accused at his residence. On the matter of
his missing, his father filed this case without consulting her. Thereafter Namtola
PS recovered us from Bimlapur PS. Police took her for medical check up and
also in court. She gave statement in court. Exbt. 1 is her statement given in
court. Exbt. 1(i) to 1(iil) are her signatures. Presently she is residing at her
matrimonial home. She has one child through the accused. In her cross-
examination she admitted that accused did not put force on her for going with

him. She on her own went with him.

10. From the evidence on record it appears that though in the FIR
allegation of abduction has been leveled against the accused Poklu Gowalla, but

during evidence, P.W. 1, the informant is totally silent on this aspect. From the

Spl. (P) Case No. 06/2018 Page 3 of 5
evidence of P.W.1, the father of the victim it reveals that due to non-finding his
daughter victim 'M' in his house he lodged the FIR. However police recovered
the victim from Bimalapur and handed over to him. On asking she informed him
that having love affairs with the accused, she on her own eloped with the
accused and stated her willingness to stay with Poklu Gowalla. P.W. 1 admitted
that presently he has accepted the relation of the victim with the accused and
presently victim is living at the residence of accused as wife and husband and
have one child. P.W.2, the victim while adducing evidence has mentioned her
age as 21 years. From her evidence it appears that she had love affairs with the
accused and on the date of incident, i.e. on 15.03.2015 as preplanned, she
eloped with the accused and performed marriage at Tingalibam Mandir and
Started living with the accused at his residence. In cross she admitted that
accused did not put force on her for going with him. She on her own eloped
with the accused. Accused is innocent and prayed for acquittal of the accused

from this case.

11. On the next charge regarding commission of penetrative sexual
assault, from the evidence of P.W. 2 the victim it reveals that on the alleged
date of occurrence she was major in age and while giving evidence in court she

was silent about physical relationship without her consent.

12. From the above evidence as discussed, it is clear that there was
no material whatsoever regarding abduction or of penetrative sexual assault

(rape) by the accused.

13. Considering above discussion, | am of the opinion that prosecution
has failed to prove the ingredients of charge U/S 366 IPC and Section 4 of
POCSO Act against the accused Poklu Gowalla. As such, accused Poklu Gowalla
is acquitted from the charges U/S 366 IPC and Section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012
and set at liberty forthwith.

14. Issue release order to the Jail Supdt. of District Jail, Sivasagar

Spl. (P) Case No. 06/2018 Page 4 of 5
forthwith.
15. As the accused is in Jail, no order is passed U/S 437 A Cr.P.C.

16. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357-A Cr.P.C.

17. Learned legal aid counsel is entitled for his professional fees from

DLSA as per rules.

18. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Charaideo U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

19. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of

on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 9th day of March
2018 Sivasagar.
