DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

7. PW 1 Sri Kalidas Tanti, father of the victim in his evidence
deposed that presently his daughter is aged about 18 years. She left school
after reading upto class IX. On 18.09.2016, at evening hours, on returning
home, | came to know that victim N was missing from the house. On knowing
this, they made search for her and during search, he learnt that accused Chulu
Tanti was also missing from his house. On this, on 22.09.2016, he lodged FIR
at Sapekhati PS. Police recovered the victim and also apprehended the accused.
On meeting his daughter at the PS, the victim stated that on her own, she went
with the accused Chulu for visit to Duliajan. She also stated that she stayed at
the residence of accused. She did not complained about any misbehave by the
accused. Exbt. 1 is my FIR. From Court he took custody of his daughter. In his
cross-examination, PW 1 admitted that accused maintained a good relation with
them and his daughter used to go with the accused on several other occasions.

He has no objection in acquittal of the accused from this case.

8. PW 2 Smt. Lalita Tanti mother of the victim in her evidence
deposed in similar line with the PW 1. She further stated that presently victim is
aged about 20 years. PW 2 also confirmed that after recovery, victim stated
that on her own she went with the accused Chulu for visit to his maternal
uncle’s house at Duliajan. She did not complained about any misbehave by the
accused. In her cross-examination, she admitted presently they have fixed the
marriage of his daughter with the accused.

9. PW 3 the victim in her evidence while claiming her present age as
20 years, deposed that on 18.09.2016, without informing her parents, on her
own she went with the accused Chulu for visit to his maternal uncle’s house at
Duliajan and stayed there for 4 days. Due to non-finding her, her father filed
this case. On this police recovered her and apprehended accused from Duliajan.
Police took her for medical examination and also to Court. She gave statement

at Sonari Court. Exbt. 2 is her statement given on that day. On that day, |

Spl. (P) Case No.52/2017 Page 3 of 5
deposed in similar lines. In her cross-examination, she admitted that accused
maintained a good relation with her family and has visiting relation. Presently
her parents fixed her marriage with the accused. Accused did not use force on
her while she went to Duliajan. Accused did not cohabit or misbehave with her

at Duliajan. She has no objection in acquittal of the accused from this case.

10. Point No. 1:- So far age of the victim is concerned, though in the
FIR the age of the victim was mentioned as 13 years, however while giving
evidence in court on 31.05.18 as P.W.3, the victim claimed her age as 20 years
and this part was corroborated by 2, the mother of the victim. However, from
the evidence of P.W. 1, the father of the victim it appears that presently victim
is aged about 18 years. As such, | hold that on the date of alleged offences,

victim was major in age.

11. Point No. 2 and 3:- From the evidence of victim (P.W. 3) it
reveals that on the day of incident, without informing her parents, she on her
own went with the accused for visit to his maternal uncle's house at Duliajan
and stayed there for four days. P.W. 1 and 2, being the parents of the victim in
their evidence has corroborated above facts. From the evidence of P.W. 1 and 2,
it reveals that while they met the victim at the P.S., she stated that she on her
own went with the accused for visit to Duliajan. Thus there is nothing to show

that either by enticing or by using force accused took the victim to Duliajan.

12. So far the allegation of penetrative sexual assault, it appears
that accused did not cohabit or misbehave with her at Duliajan and during that
period she slept with the aunt of the accused. This part was also corroborated
by PW 1 and 2. Before them also victim did not complain about any misbehave
by the accused. So there is absolutely nothing in the evidence of P.W. 1, P.W. 2
and P.W. 3 implicating the accused with the alleged offence of abduction and

aggravated penetrative sexual assault on the victim.

13. Considering above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has failed

Spl. (P) Case No.52/2017 Page 4 of 5
to prove the ingredients of offence U/S 366 IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act
2012 against the accused Sri Chulu Tanti. As such, accused Sri Chulu Tanti is
acquitted from the charges U/S 366 IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act 2012 and
Set at liberty forthwith.

14. Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety stand extended
for another six months from today U/S 437-A Cr.P.C.

15. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to
DLSA for granting compensation U/S 357 (A) Cr.P.C.

16. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

Li Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on
contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 31°t day of May
