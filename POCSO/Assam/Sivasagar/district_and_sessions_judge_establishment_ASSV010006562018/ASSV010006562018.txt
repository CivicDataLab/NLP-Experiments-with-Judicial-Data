2012 and Section 376 (i) [PC has been framed against the accused to which he

examined two witnesses viz. the informant and victim.

5. Considering the nature of evidence of victim and informant,

examination of accused u/s 313 Cr.P.C is dispenses with.

6. | have heard argument of Id. Special P.P. Mr. Srimanta Gogoi and
Mr. D.M. Neog, learned defence counsel and gone through the evidence on

record. | have considered the submission of both the sides.
POINT FOR DETERMINATION IS:

7. (1) Whether prior to few months back of filing FIR on 21.05.18,

accused committed sexual assault on the victim 'P'?
DECI SION AND REASONS THEREOF:

8. PW-1 Smt. Maya Mirdha, mother of the victim in her evidence
deposed that her daughter, victim P is presently aged about 20 years. About 3-
4 months back of filing FIR, her daughter victim 'P' was married to accused and
he stayed in her house with her daughter. However during her pregnancy, NGO
people came to her house and took her, the victim and the accused to Demow
P.S. and took her thumb impression (Tl) marks in one paper. Subsequently,
police arrested the accused and forwarded him to Jail custody. Presently victim
and accused are living at her residence as wife and husband and they have one
child. In her cross examination, PW 1 admitted that she lodged the FIR on
being forced by NGO people. She did not want to prosecute this case any

further. She has no objection in acquittal of the accused from this case.

9. PW-2 the victim P in her evidence deposed that accused is her
husband and presently she is aged about 20 years. Having love affairs with
Special (P) Case No. 19 of 2018 Page 2 of 4
accused Ajay Saora, about a year back, they performed marriage and started
living at her paternal house. However NGO people by taking them and her
mother to Demow PS, filed a false case claiming her as minor. Police took her
for medical check-up and also in court. She gave her statement in court. On
that day, she deposed in similar lines. Presently she is residing at her
matrimonial home with the accused and has one child through the accused. In
her cross-examination, the victim has admitted that accused did not put force

on her for marriage. Accused is innocent.

10. So far charge of sexual assault is concerned, from the evidence of
PW-1 and PW-2, it appears that victim is aged about 20 years and hence she
has right to choose her life partner. PW-1 being the mother of the victim in her
evidence categorically stated that about 3-4 months back of filing FIR, victim
was married to accused and accused used to remain in her house with her
daughter. Both PW-1 and PW-2 in their evidence clearly stated that during
pregnancy of the victim, NGO people came to their house and took them to
Demow PS and by taking the thumb impression of PW-1 in one paper, filed this
false case on the pretext that victim is minor. PW-2 the victim also admitted
that accused did not put force on her for marriage. So from the evidence of
PW-1 and PW-2, it appears that the allegation brought against the accused was
not supported by the informant as well as the victim herself. In her evidence
the victim nowhere stated that accused has committed sexual assault/rape on
her against her will.

11. Considering above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has failed
to prove the ingredients of charge u/s 4 of POCSO Act 2012 and Section 376 (1)
IPC against the accused Sri Ajay Saora. As such accused Ajay Saora Is acquitted
from the charge u/s 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and Section 376 (I) IPC and set at
liberty forthwith.

12. Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety is extended for
next six months from today u/s 437-A Cr.P.C.

14. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,

15. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 25" day of
