8. PW-1 Smt. Minu Das, the mother of the victim and informant of

Spl (P) Case No. 36/2017 Page 2 of 6
this case in her evidence deposed that her daughter the victim K was is
presently reading in class |X and aged about 14 years. On 20.07.2017, at about
3 PM on returning home from field, her husband Nathu Das and neighbours has
informed her that while the victim was reading in the house by staying alone
and her husband was in the shop, accused Aptar Ali came to her house and
asked for a glass of water from her daughter. On asking her daughter she also
Stated that when accused Aptar came to house and while she was about to give
water to him, she suddenly fell down and become senseless. While Aptar picked
up on his lap, neighbours have seen the incident and compelled her to file the
FIR. On being forced she filed the FIR vide Exbt. 1. In her cross-examination
she admitted that she cannot say about the contents of the FIR. She cannot say
who wrote the FIR. She just put her signature on being asked by locals.
Accused Aptar used to frequently visit her house. She has no objection in

acquittal of the accused from this case.

9. PW-2, the victim K in her evidence deposed that she is presently
reading in class |X and aged about 14 years. On 20.07.2017, at about 12 Noon,
when she along with her father was in their house, and reading, accused Aptar
Ali came to their house and asked her for a glass of water. Her father went to
nearby shop for bringing beetle nut for the accused. Suddenly accused entered
inside the house and out of fear she fell down and become senseless. While
Aptar attempted to hold her, her father and neighbours have seen the incident.
At that time her mother went to field. On return of her mother, she informed
the matter to her. Out of anger she lodged FIR. Police came to investigate the
matter and interrogated me. Police took me to hospital and also in court. She
has given statement in Court vide Exbt. 2. While giving statement in court she
had deposed in similar lines. In her cross-examination she admitted that her
father went to nearby shop. As her father saw the accused in holding her while
falling, on suspect, the case was filed. Accused did not misbehave her in any

manner. He just hold her as she fell down.

Spl (P) Case No. 36/2017 Page 3 of 6
10. PW-3 Sri Nathu Das in her evidence deposed that his daughter is
presently reading in class |X and aged about 14 years. On 20.07.2017, at about
1 PM accused Aptar came to his house and asked to have a beetle nut. On this
he went to nearby shop and on return home he saw that accused Aptar while
holding the victim on her falling down. On return of his wife she narrated the
incident to her. On being forced by neighbours her wife filed the FIR. In his
cross-examination he admitted that the beetle nut shop was not near to his
house. He returned home within few minute. They have to file the case as
neighbours compelled them to do so. He has seen the accused in misbehaving
his daughter in any manner. She also did not report him of any ill treatment by

accused in her absence. He did not want to prosecute the case.

11. From the evidence of P.W.1, P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 it is seen that on
the date of alleged incident, victim is aged about 14 years. Defence did not

challenge this fact.

12. So far charge of sexual assault is concerned, from the evidence of
PW 1 to PW 3 it appears that none of them deposed anything against the
accused implicating him with the alleged offences. From their evidence it
appears that on the date of incident, while victim was reading in the house by
Staying alone, accused came to their house and asked for a glass of water from
the victim and when accused entered inside the house and while victim was
about to give water to him, victim suddenly fell down and while accused picked
up the victim, by that time victim's father (P.W.3) arrived there and saw the
accused in holding the victim while she fell down. Neighbours have also seen
the incident and on being forced by neighbours P.W.1 lodged the FIR. In her
cross-examination, P.W. 2 admitted that accused did not commit ill treatment to

her. She clearly stated that accused just hold her while she was falling down.

13. So far allegation of house trespass is concerned it is in the
evidence of witnesses that accused Is a regular visitor to the house of the

informant being a vendor of cloth business. Hence in absence of prove of prime

Spl (P) Case No. 36/2017 Page 4 of 6
charge, it cannot be said that on that he committed house trespass with an

intention to commit an offence.

14. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the charges U/S 451 IPC and Section 10 of POCSO Act, 2012 or
any other minor offences against the accused Md. Aptar Ali. As such,
accused Md. Aptar Ali is acquitted from the charges U/S 451 IPC and Section 10
of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

15. Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety are extended for
another six months from today U/S 437-A Cr.P.C

16. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to
DLSA for granting compensation U/S 357 A Cr.P.C.

17. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate, Sivasagar
U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

18. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 7" day of February
