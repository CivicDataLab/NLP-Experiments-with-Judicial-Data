DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

9. PW 1, the victim 'M' in her evidence deposed that accused Hontu
Kurmi is Known to her being Cousin. Presently she is aged about 14 years. She
is reading in class IX in Dhitaipukhuri High School. On 23.03.2019, at about
3.30 PM, while she was alone in her house and cutting firewood in front side
court yard, accused Hontu came to her house and asked for lipstick. On her
denial to have any lipstick with her, accused left her house. Thereafter while she
was again busy in cutting fire wood and entered her house to keep the dao,
accused suddenly assaulted her on her head from her backside. She sustained
bleeding injury on her head. She became senseless. She was taken to Lakuwa
Hospital and she regained her sense at Lakwa Hospital. Her younger brother
Dipu Kurmi informed her that accused sent him to bring Kamala Pasand and for
giving the same to accused, while Dipu entered their house, he saw her laying
with injuries and that accused was in sitting inside the house. From Lakwa she
was brought to Sivasagar Civil Hospital where she stayed for 3 days as indoor
patient. Therefrom, she was referred to Dibrugarh for better treatment. On this
incident, her brother Santosh Kurmi has filed an FIR. Police took her to Nazira
Hospital for medical checkup. Police took her for medical check up and also in
Court. She gave her statement in Court. Exbt. 1 is her statement in Court. Exbt.
1(i) is her signatures. In her cross by defence the victim admitted that accused
is the son of her uncle. He resides in different house in same court-yard.
Accused used to like her a lot as sister and use to play with her. She gave her
statement in Court. While giving statement in Court and to Police, she has not
Stated that “Her brother Dipu Kurmi informed her that accused sent him to

bring Kamala Pasand and for giving the same to accused, while Dipu entered

Spl. (P)Case No. 19/19 Page 3 of 6
their house, he saw her laying with injuries and that accused was in sitting
inside the house.” She has not seen the accused in assaulting her. Even she has
not seen the accused in her house. She has seen him in entering her house
after his return on her denial of having lipstick. She named the accused on
being informed by her brother Dipu. She denied that she sustained injury by
falling on her own. She further denied that accused did not assault her. She
Stated that accused used to consume liquor and make quarrel in the village. On
this matter, a village meeting was also held. VDP Secretary Pradip Gogoi and
Phuleswar Kurmi are known to her. Presently they have compromised the
matter with the accused as he is her first cousin. She has no objection if the

accused is acquitted from this case.

10. PW 2 Sri Santosh Kurmi, the informant of this case, in his
evidence deposed that accused Hantu Kurmi is his cousin. Victim 'M' is his
younger sister. She is aged about 14-15 years. On 23.03.2019, at about 4 PM,
while returned home, he saw that local people were preparing to take the
victim to Hospital for the injuries on her head. From his younger brother Dipu,
he came to know that he saw the victim 'M' while laying inside the house with
injuries. She was taken to Lakuwa Bagan Hospital and on the next day morning
she was brought to Sivasagar Civil Hospital where she stayed for two nights as
indoor patient. Therefrom, victim was referred to Dibrugarh for better
treatment. On this incident, he filed one FIR vide Exbt. 2. Exbt. 2(i) is his
Signatures. In his cross examination, he admitted that he has not seen the
incident on his own. His brother Dipu did not tell him that he saw the accused
in assaulting victim. The victim 'M' also could not recognize the assailant. FIR
was written by others at Police Station. He cannot say the contents of the FIR.
Before police, he has not stated that “From his younger brother Dipu, he came
to know that he saw the victim 'M' while laying inside the house with injuries.”
Presently they have compromised the matter with the accused as he is his first
cousin. He has no objection if the accused is acquitted from this case.

11. From the evidence of PW.1 and P.W. 2 it is seen that they

deposed nothing against the accused person implicating him with the alleged
Spl. (P)Case No. 19/19 Page 4 of 6
offences. The victim in her examination-in-chief though stated that while she
entered her house to keep the dao, accused suddenly assaulted her on her
head from backside and she sustained bleeding injury on her head, but from
her cross examination as stated herein before, it appears that she has not seen
the accused in assaulting her from backside. Even she has not seen the accused
in her house. She admitted that she named the accused on being informed by
her brother Dipu. In her cross the victim has stated that accused used to like
her a lot as sister and used to play with her The victim in her evidence
nowhere mentioned that she was criminally intimidated or that she was
Subjected to sexual assault by the accused. In her cross the victim admitted
that presently they have compromised the matter with the accused as he is her
first cousin and she has no objection in acquittal of the accused from this case.
In his cross examination PW 2 (informant) admitted that that he has not seen
the incident on his own and his brother Dipu did not tell him that he has seen
the accused in assaulting the victim. PW 2 further admitted that victim could
not recognize the assailant. So from the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2 it appears
that the allegations brought against the accused are not supported by the
victim and her elder brother, i.e. PW 2. Offence u/s 323 IPC is otherwise
compoundable. Thus from the above evidence on record, it appears that the
ingredients of offences u/s 323/451/354 IPC and Section 8 of POCSO Act, 2012
are totally missing in this case.

12. Considering above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the ingredients of charges u/s 323/451/354 IPC and Section 8
of POCSO Act, 2012 against the accused Sri Hontu Kurmi. As such, accused Sri
Hontu Kurmi is acquitted from the charges u/s 323/451/354 IPC and Section 8
of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith. Inform the Jail authority to
release the accused forthwith.

13. Issue release order to the Superintendent, District J ail, Sivasagar
accordingly. As the accused is in Jail, no order is passed u/s 437-A Cr.P.C.

14. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to

DLSA for granting compensation u/s 357-A CrP.C.

Spl. (P)Case No. 19/19 Page 5 of 6
15. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar u/s 365 CrP.C.
16. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of
on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 1st day of
