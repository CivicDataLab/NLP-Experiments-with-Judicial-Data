JUDGMENT

The prosecution case in brief is that one Tapan Das had lodged a
FIR at Chapar P.S. to the effect that on 30-06-2013 at around 1 p.m. his minor
daughter and his daughter-in-law Pushpa Das had been to the nearby forest to
collect fire woods. The accused Omar Ali with the design to commit rape on the
victim had asked Pushpa Das to look for any forest officer coming to the forest
and when Pushpa Das was away, the accused caught hold of Sefali Das and
gagged her and had committed rape on her. His daughter-in-law when tried to

intervene the accused by means of an axe threatened to kill her.

2. A case was registered by the O.C, Chapar Police Station U/s. 8 of
the POCSO Act, 2012 against the accused. The case was investigated into by the
I.0. and after completion of investigation, charge sheet had been filed against
the accused Omar Ali u/s.8 of the POCSO Act, 2012.

3. Accused person appeared before the Court. The charge u/s.8 of
POCSO Act, 2012 had been framed against the accused Omar Ali. Charge had
been read over, explained and interpreted to accused to which accused pleaded

not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4. The prosecution had examined as many as 8 (eight) witnesses
including the I.0. & M.O. Considering there being no incriminating materials
against the accused, the necessity to examine the accused generally u/s.313 of

Cr.PC. is done away with.

5. POINT FOR DETERMINATION

Whether the accused on 30-06-2013 at around 1 p.m. at
the village Chagalkuti under Chapar P.S. committed sexual assault on

the daughter of the informant who is under the age of 18 years?

DECISIONS AND REASONS THEREON

6. PW-1, Tapan Das the informant in the case has not supported the
FIR as much as in the cross examination PW-1 disowned having written the FIR
or for that matter knowing about the contents of the FIR. PW-2, Smti Pushpa

Das was declared hostile by the prosecution.

7. Coming to the evidence of PW-7 Dr. (Mrs) Rinku Ahmed, Sr.
Medical & Health Officer, Maternity and Health Centre, Dhubri, I find that during
her examination of the victim on 26-09-2012, PW-7 did not find any mark of
violence on the body of the victim and in her opinion, there was no evidence of
rape on the body of the victim. Ext-1 is her report bearing her signature ext-1

(1). According to PW-7 the radiological age of the victim was below 18 years.

8. Now having gone through the evidence of Medical Officer, I find
that the findings of the MO is consistent with the evidence of the victim, PW-7,
who has not uttered a single word against the accused having committed sexual
assault on her. The PW-7 attributed the cause for filing the present case is the
heated exchange of words between the accused and her sister-in-law since the
accused had prevented them from collecting fire woods and she had been
present at the scene of occurrence. Thus it is evident that the circumstances
surfaced in the evidence of the victim and the findings of the Medical Officer do
not point a finger of accusation at the accused. Coming to the evidence of PW-3,
Dulal Das, the brother of the victim, PW-4, the mother of the victim, PW-5, a

 

[Special Case No.17/2014] Page 2
neighbour of the victim, it has come to light in their evidence that none of these
witnesses who are close relatives of victim had in any way implicated the
accused of committing sexual assault on the victim. Thus it is evident that the
circumstances surfacing in the evidence of PWs do not indicate any sexual
assault for the purpose of Section 7 of the POCSO Act to have been committed
by the accused on the victim, PW-7.

9. Thus summing up the discussion of the evidence of witnesses on
the prosecution side, it is clear that prosecution has failed to establish the
charge u/s.8 of the POCSO Act beyond all reasonable doubt against the

accused. The accused is acquitted and set at liberty forthwith.

10. However, I am _ inclined to recommend the victim for
compensation u/s.357 (A) of Cr.PC. The Secretary, DLSA, Dhubri to assess the
quantum of compensation to be paid after due inquiry. The copy of the

judgment be sent to the Secretary, DLSA, Dhubri.

Given under my hand and seal of the Court on this 24" day of
June, 2016.
