JUDGMENT

 

1 Md. Hamid Sheikh (hereinafter referred to as “accused”) is before this court
facing accusation for the commission of offence U/s.376(2)(i) of I.P.C. & Sec. 4 of

Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

2. The prosecution case, in brief, is that the informant Mustt. Asma Bibi lodged
an FIR with the In-Charge, Daobhangi Police Petrol Post under Gauripur P.S. on

13.5.18 and /nter-alia stated that on the last night at about 8-30 P.M, her 15 years
old daughter Miss. 'X' went to fetch water from the tubewell, at that time, accused
Abdul Hanif and his father Moinul Hoque hatched conspiracy, abducted her minor
daughter by gagging her mouth, carried her on shoulder, took to a nearby bamboo
bushes and committed rape upon her. When the informant searched her daughter,
she found her daughter in a naked condition and when the accused persons saw
the informant, they fled away. The informant lodged the FIR and prayed for action

against the accused persons.

3. Based on the FIR, police registered Gauripur PS. Case No.544/18
U/s.120(B)/342/376/34 I.P.C and Sec.4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and commenced the

investigation of the case.

4. The police after investigation, submitted charge-sheet against the accused
person U/s. 120(B)/342/376/34 I.P.C and Sec.4 of POCSO Act, 2012. When
summons was issued from the court, the accused person entered his appearance.

The relevant copies were furnished to the accused person.

5. The charge U/s. 376(2)(i) of I.P.C. & Sec. 4 of Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Act, 2012 was framed against the accused person. The charge
was read over and explained to the accused person to which he pleaded not guilty

and claimed to be tried.

6. The prosecution in order to establish the guilt of the accused person examined
as many as four witnesses. The statement of the accused U/s.313 CrP.C was

recorded. The accused person pleaded his innocence.
7. Heard both sides.

8. POINTS FOR DETERMINATION :
i) Whether the accused person on 12.05.2018 at about 8-30 PM
committed rape on the daughter of the informant under the age of

sixteen and thereby committed an offence U/s.376(i)(2) of I.P.C.

ii) Whether the accused on the same date and time committed
penetrative sexual assault on the minor daughter of the informant and

thereby committed an offence U/s.4 of POCSO Act, 2012.
9. DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF :

The charges against the accused are that the accused person committed

rape as well as penetrative sexual assault on the minor daughter of the informant.

PW-1 'X' in her evidence stated that the incident occurred about 6/7
months ago. PW-1, the victim in her statement stated that on the date of the
incident, she was speaking with the accused person and when her mother saw, she

lodged the FIR but the accused person did not commit anything.

PW-2 Asma Bibi, the mother of the victim in her evidence stated that her
daughter was speaking with the accused and when she saw, she suspected and

lodged the FIR.

PW-3 & 4 Awal Ali and Tarabhanu Bibi in their evidence stated that they

do not know about the facts of the incident.

10. | When the evidence on record taken as a whole, it is evident that ingredients
U/s. 376(2)(i) of I.P.C. & Sec. 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
2012 are totally lacking as such, I do not find it to convict the accused person as
the prosecution evidence does not establish the guilt of the accused person.

Accordingly, the accused person is acquitted from the charge U/s. 376(2)(i) of
I.P.C. & Sec. 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and set at
liberty, forthwith. His bail bond shall remain in force for a period of six months in

terms of Sec.437A Cr.P.C.

Given under my hand and seal of this court on this 8" day of January,2020 at

Dhubri.
