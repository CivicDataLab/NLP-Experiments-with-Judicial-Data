To substantiate the case, prosecution examined as many as seven witnesses\\which include informant and victim.\nAfter examination of the 7 witness,\nlearned Counsel for the accused submitted to close the prosecution evidence on the ground that this is a case under Section 4 of POCSO Act, where the victim no way support the prosecution case and it would be futile to examine the other witnesses.\nThereafter, her father along with one Subba filed this case.\nAfter instituting the case, she made statement before the learned Magistrate under Section 164 CrPC.\nTherefore, the victim no way reveals any material against any of the accused.\n",
    "issue": "10. The point for decision in this case is that  (1) Whether on 26-05-2017, at Kalamati,\nRupanjal, under Missamari PS, the accused persons committed penetrative sexual assault on Miss \"X and thereby committed an _ offence punishable under Section 4 of POCSO Act?\n\nReasons, Decisions and reason for decision:\n\n \n\n11.\n",
    "ANALYSIS": "The local public caught the aecused persons and handed over to police.\nEven they have no-any. objection, if the accused persons are enlarged on acquittal.\nDuring that time, she interpreted the language of the victim into Assamese.\nAll the accused persons came separately.\nPolice recorded her statement.\nShe does not know whether the victim can speak or understand Assamese language.\n\n19.\nThe accused persons are charged under Section 4 of POCSO Act.\nTo prove under Section 4 of POCSO Act, prosecution must prove the ingredients as enumerated Section 3 of POCSO Act.\n\n\n21. Penetrative Sexual assault  \n\nThe statement of victim Miss X does not reveal any ingredients of the aforesaid Section.\nTherefore, charge under Section 4 of POCSO Act failed.\n",
