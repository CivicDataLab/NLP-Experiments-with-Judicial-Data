    "issue": "\nPOINTS FOR DETERMINATION ARE - 6.\n(1) What was the age of the victim 'P' on the date of incident?\n\n\n(11) Whether on 22.01.2017 victim 'P' was subjected to sexual assault by the accused?\n",
    "ANALYSIS": "Thus the evidence of victim appears to be exaggerated on material point and did not get any support so far holding her hand, pulling her to roadside jungle and demanding for kiss by the accused and laying her on the ground.\nThus her evidence appears to untrustworthy and cannot be relied upon for drawing presumption u/s 29 of Pocso Act.\n14. Considering the available materials on record, | am of the opinion that it is fit case where accused should be given the benefit of doubt, simply because mere going with a minor girl by the side of the road cannot be an offence under the provision of POCSO Act or any other law.\nProsecution has failed to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt.\n",
    "decision": "15. Considering all above, accused Bicky Kr. Jha is acquitted from the charge U/S 8 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.\nBail bond executed by the accused and his surety are extended for another six months from today U/S 437-A Cr.P.C.\n\n17.\nConsidering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S 357-A Cr.P.C.\n\n18.\nJudgment is pronounced in open court.\n"
