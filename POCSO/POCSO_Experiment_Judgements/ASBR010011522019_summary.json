    "facts": "During the course of investigation, police recorded the statement of the witnesses, drew sketch map, sent the victim girl for medical examination, forwarded her to court for recording her statement before Magistrate u/s 164 Cr.P.C. and arrested the accused person.\nOn completion of investigation police finally laid the charge sheet against accused u/s 448/376(2)(n) IPC and section 4 of POCSO Act.\n3. During the course of time, when accused appeared in court after due compliance of section 207 Cr.P.C. formal charges u/s 376(2)(n)/448 IPC and section 4 of POCSO Act were framed after perusing the materials on record and hearing both sides.\nDuring the course of trial, the prosecution examined only 2 witnesses namely- the informant Hamed Ali as PW-1 and the alleged victim girl as PW-2.\n",
    "ANALYSIS": "The defense plea is total denial of the prosecution case.\nAs such, on being asked accused declined to adduce defense evidence.\n\n(2) Whoever, -\n(a) being a police officer, commits rape - (i) within the limits of the police station to which such police officer is appointed; or (ii) in the premises of any station house; or (iii) on a woman in such police officer's custody or in the custody of a police officer subordinate to such police officer,or (b) being a public servant, commits rape on a woman in such public servant's custody or in the custody of a public servant subordinate to such public servant; or (c) being a member of the armed forces deployed in an area by the Central or a State Government commits rape in such area; or (d) being on the management or on the staff of a jail, remanded home or other place of custody established by or under any law for the time being in force or of a women's or children's institution, commits rape on any inmate of such jail, remand home, place or institution; or (e) being on the management or on the staff of a hospital, commits rape on a woman in that hospital; or (f) being a relative , guardian or teacher of, or a person in a position of trust or authority towards the woman, commits rape on such woman; or (g) commits rape during communal or sectarian violence; or (h) commits rape on a woman knowing her to pregnant; or (i) commits rape on a woman when she is under sixteen years of age; or (j) commits rape on a woman incapable of giving consent; or (k) being in a position of control or dominance over a woman, commits rape on such woman; or (1) commits rape on a woman suffering from mental or physical disability; or (m)wile committing rape causes grievous bodily harm or maims or disfigures or endangers the life of a woman; or (n) commits rape repeatedly on the same woman,\nshall be punished with rigorous impression for a term which shall not be less than ten years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life, and shall also be liable to fine.\nNow, on perusal of the offence u/s 3 of POCSO Act it appears that section 3 defined the nature of the act/acts which constitutes the penetrative sexual assault and section 4 of the POCSO Act provides punishment for any of the act/acts done by accused as defined in section 3 (a) to (d) of POCSO Act.\n\n10.\nIn the present case PW-1 the informant in his evidence stated that he lodge the FIR Ext. 1 against accused but now accused married his daughter by executing registered Kabin.\nThere is no evidence of commission of any offence by accused either u/s 376(2)(n)/448 IPC and section 4 of POCSO Act.\n13. This being the position, this court is of the considered view that prosecution has failed to establish the case against accused Alaluddin u/s 376(2)(n)/448 IPC and section 4 of POCSO Act as there was absolutely no materials emerged for having found the accused person guilty for sustaining conviction for the aforesaid offences.\n",
    "issue": "Whether on 26.02.2019 at about 7 pm accused repeatedly committed rape on the victim by wrongfully entering in side the house as alleged ?\n\n\n2. Whether on the same day and time accused committed house trespass by entering in to the residence of the victim with intent to commit the offence of rape as alleged ?\n\n3. Whether on the same day and time accused committed penetrating sexual assault on the victim girl or force her to do so with him as alleged ?\n\n7. Discussion, Decision and reasons for such decision :-\n",
    "decision": "Therefore, this court has no option but to acquit the accused Alaluddin from the offence u/s 376(2)(n)/448 IPC and section 4 of POCSO Act on the ground of insufficient evidence and set him at liberty forthwith.\n14. The terms of bail bond of accused person is however extended for a period of 6 (six)\nmonths from to-day as provided u/s 437(A) Cr.P.C.\n\n15.\nLet a copy of the judgment be forwarded to the learned District Magistrate, Barpeta as provided in section 365 Cr.P.C.\n\n16.\n"
