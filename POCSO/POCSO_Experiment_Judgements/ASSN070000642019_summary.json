    "facts": "One Santosh Keot had seen Arjun in the light of his motor cycle and heard her daughter's cry.\nWhen he arrived there, the miscreants fled after leaving the victim.\n\n2. Receiving the same, the police registered a case and investigated the matter.\nAfter investigation the police submitted charge sheet against the accused persons u/s ey 376/511/34 IPC r/w Section 8 of POCSO Act, 2012.\nTaking note of the materials furnished u/s 173 Se CrPC and upon hearing both the sides on the point of charge, as this court found grounds we for presuming that the accused persons had committed offences u/s 511/34 read with Sec.\n 376 IPC/ 4 of POCSO Act, 2012, the charges were accordingly framed against them, which on being read over and explained, they pleaded not guilty.\nDuring trial, the prosecution examined the informant/mother of the victim as PW 1 and the victim as PW 2.\nLooking into the evidence as adduced by these vital witnesses, more particularly, the evidence of the victim- PW 2, the prosecution declined to examine the remaining witnesses contending that further evidence would not strengthen its case.\nAs no incriminating evidence was found against the accused persons, the prosecution evidence was closed and the examination of the accused persons u/s 313 CrPC were dispensed with.\n",
    "issue": "Points for determination . Whether the accused persons on the day of the alleged occurrence attempted to yy earn rape on the said victim in furtherance of their common intention?\n\n2.\nWhether the accused persons on the day of the alleged occurrence committed sexual assault on the said victim?\n",
    "ANALYSIS": "\n\nThus from the evidence of both these vital witnesses, more particularly, from the evidence of PW 2, we do not find any evidence against the accused persons to convict them on the offences charged against them.\nThe prosecution has failed to prove its case.\n",
    "decision": "As such I acquit the accused persons from the offences charged against them and set them at liberty forthwith.\nTheir bail bonds are discharged.\nThe provision of Sec. 437-A CrPC is not complied with after taking note of the evidence on record.\nThe case is disposed of.\n"
