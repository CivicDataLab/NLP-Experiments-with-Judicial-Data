DISCUSSIONS, DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF:

 

6. I have carefully perused the evidence and the materials
available in the case record. Heard arguments advanced by the Ld.
Advocates of both sides. Now, let us examine the evidence on record
to decide the case at hand.

7. PW.1, Smti Atuary Verla @ Vedra (wife of informant),

person. The occurrence took place about one year back. The accused

victim daughter along with her child is staying in her house at present.
The present age of her victim daughter is about 15/ 16 years. Her

person concerned is above 15 years and below 17 years. (X

10. External injury : No external injury over the private parts

Opinion: No evidence of recent sexual intercourse. She is

Ext.2 is her medical report and Ext.2 (1) is her signature
thereon.
9. PW.3, Sri Narayan Bhadra (informant cum father of

victim), stated that he knows the accused person. The occurrence took
place about 2 years back. There was love affair between the accused
person and his daughter. Despite giving promise, the accused person

did not marry his daughter and so, he lodged this case against him.
The accused person never did any bad acts upon his daughter. His
victim daughter also has not disclosed as from whose side she became
pregnant. Ext.4 is the ejahar lodged by him and Ext.4(1) is his

signature thereon.

10. PW.4, the victim girl, stated that the informant is her
father. She knows the accused person. She also stated that despite
giving promise to marry her, the accused person did not marry her and
so, her father lodged this case against the accused. The accused person
never did any bad acts upon her. She does not know as to from whose
side she became pregnant.

11. PW5, Iswar Bhadra, stated that he knows both the
parties. The occurrence took place about 2 years back. There was love

affair between the accused and the victim. Other than this, he knows

nothing.
12. PW6, Sri Rajesh Barla, stated in the same tune as stated
by PW5.
Appreciation of evidence:
(Offence u/s- 376 of IPC
13. Here, the victim girl (PW4) is the prime witness in the

instant case. Her evidence is that she had love affairs with the accused
person prior to the alleged incident and due to not marrying her by the
accused person, her father lodged this case only on suspicion against
the accused person.

During cross, PW4 (victim girl) stated that she has no
any allegation against the accused person. She gave her statement
before the Court as per instruction of the police.

Thus, it is seen that the victim girl in her deposition

nowhere uttered a single word that the accused committed rape on her.
Rather, she stated that she has no allegation against the accused.

14. The version of the informant, father of the victim girl
(PW3) is that the accused person did not marry his daughter though
they had love affairs between them. The accused person never did any
bad acts upon his daughter.

15. PW3, PW5 and PW6 are not eye witnesses to see the
occurrence. They do not support at all the prosecution case.

16. PW2 is the M/O. She found no recent sexual intercourse
on the victim (PW4).

17. Offence u/s- 493 of IPC.

There is no evidence on record to show that the accused
had cohabited with the victim (PW4) with a false promise to marry
her.

18. Offence w/s- 420 of IPC.

Prosecution witnesses did not state that accused cheated
the victim (PW4) in any manner.

19. Offence u/s- 4 of POCSO Act.

The prosecutrix (PW4), in her deposition nowhere stated
that the accused person had committed any sexual assault on her
person. Rather, she stated that the accused person did not commit any
wrong upon her. Her father lodged this case, due to not getting marry
her by the accused person.

PW3, PW5 and PW6 do not support at all the prosecution
case.

PW2, the M/O, found no any evidence of recent sexual
intercourse on the victim (PW4).

It is thus, seen that the ingredients of offence u/s- 4 of

POCSO Act are lacking in this present case.
20. In view of the above discussions and considering all
aspects, I hold that the prosecution has failed to prove the case wu/s-
376/493/420 of IPC, R/w- Sec. 4 of POCSO Act against the accused
person beyond all reasonable doubts. Hence, I acquit him from the
said offences.

21. The accused person is set at liberty forthwith.

22. The case is disposed of accordingly.

Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 7"

day of January, 2019.
