after hearing the learned advocates of both sides and perusing the case record,
sufficient materials under Sections 342/376/506 IPC and under Sec.6 of the
POCSO Act had been found against the accused, Md. Abidur Rahman @ Dilku in

person, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

Lakhimpur P.S.?
(11) | Whether the accused person thereafter committed rape on the victim X?

PW.1, Musstt. Halima Begum is the mother of the victim X.
She, in her evidence, stated that the accused, Md. Abidur Rahman is known to

4 Special Case No.18/2016.

her. The victim X is her daughter. She also stated that at the time of occurrence,
the victim X was of 16 years old and was reading in school. She, in her evidence,
also stated that there was love affairs between the accused, Abidur Rahman and
the victim X. She also stated that her neighbour informed her that the accused
and the victim X were talking with each other in the house of the accused
secretly. Thereafter, she informed the matter to the school teacher of the victim
X, and the school teacher advised her to lodge a case against the accused
person, and accordingly, she lodged the case against the accused. She, in her
evidence, further stated that when she asked the victim X, she stated that she
was simply talking with the accused. PW.1, in her evidence, did not implicate the

accused person regarding commission of any offence.

PW.2 is the victim X. She, in her evidence, stated that at
the time of occurrence, she was reading in class-VII1. She also stated that she
had love affairs with the accused, who is her neighbour. She, in her evidence,
also stated that one day, she was talking with the accused in his house and the
neighbours on seeing them talking with each other, informed the matter to her
mother, and then her mother informed the matter to her school teacher. She also
stated that her school teacher advised her mother to lodge a case, and
accordingly her mother lodged the case. PW.2, the victim X, in her evidence, did

not implicate the accused regarding commission of any offence with her.

PW.3, Smti Runu Bora is a retired teacher. She, in her
evidence, stated that she knows the accused, Abidur Rahman and the victim X.
She also stated that at the time of occurrence the victim X was reading in class-
IV in Moidomia M.E. School. She, in her evidence, also stated that on the day of
occurrence, the victim X did not attend her class, and then she sent a female
student into the house of the victim X to enquire why the victim X did not attend
her classes. She also stated that then the mother of the victim X informed them
that the accused had committed rape on the victim X. After knowing about the
occurrence, she advised the mother of the victim X to lodge a case before the
police. She, in her cross-examination, stated that she had no direct knowledge

about the occurrence. She also stated that it is the mother of the victim X, who
knows the actual occurrence. She, in her evidence, also stated that she had
come to know from the mother of the victim X that the accused had committed
rape on the victim X. But, PW.1, the mother of the victim X did not state that she
had stated to Smti Runu Bora (PW.3) that the accused committed rape on the
victim X. So, the evidence adduced by the PW.3, Smti Runu Bora that the mother
of the victim X had informed her that the accused committed rape on the victim

X, is no evidence at all. It is an inadmissible evidence.

PW.4, Musstt. Jahida Khatun is the teacher of Moidomia
L.P. School. She, in her evidence, stated that she knows the accused person. The
house of the accused is situated near Moidomia L.P. School, and at the time of
occurrence, the victim X was reading in her school and she was absent in her
class for 4/5 days. Then, the Headmistress of the school went to the mother of
the victim X to enquire regarding absence of the victim X in the school, and then
the mother of the victim X told to the Headmistress that the victim X had not
attended her classes in the school due to some ill-acts committed by the accused
person on the victim X. She, in her evidence, also stated that the mother of the
victim X reported the matter to the Headmistress of the school and not to her.
She also stated that she had not gone to the place of occurrence to collect any
information. From her evidence, it is found that the mother of the victim X had
told the Headmistress of the school that the victim X had not attended her class
in the school as the accused had done some ill-acts on the victim X. She further
stated that the mother of the victim X had reported the matter not to her but to
the Headmistress of the school. So, it is not known how she came to know about
the occurrence that the accused had done some ill-acts on the victim X. She, in
her evidence, also did not state whether she came to know about the occurrence

either from the mother of the victim X or from the Headmistress of the school.

PW.1, Musstt. Halima Begum, the mother of the victim X

and PW.3, Smti Runu Bora, the Headmistress of the school, in their evidence, did
not state that they had narrated the occurrence to PW.4. So, the evidence

Contd...
6 Special Case No.18/2016.

adduced by the PW.4 is an inadmissible piece of evidence. It has no value in the

eye of law.

PW.5 is Dr. Kalpana Goswami, who had examined the
victim X. She, in her evidence, stated that the victim X at the time of her medical
examination was in the age of above 15 years and below 17 years, and at the
time of medical examination, she had not found any sign of recent forced sexual

intercourse on her person.

11. As the prosecution witnesses examined, mainly the
victim X and her mother (PW.1) have not implicated the accused person in their
evidence regarding commission of any offence, so elaborate discussion of the
evidence adduced by the PW.5, Dr Kalpana Goswami in my opinion is not

necessary.

12. Because of what have been discussed and pointed out
here-in-above, it is appeared that the prosecution side has totally failed to prove
the charges under Sections 342/376/506 IPC and under Sec.6 of the POCSO Act
brought against the accused person, Md. Abidur Rahman @ Dilku and the

accused person deserves to be acquitted.

13. |, therefore, hold the accused person, Md. Abidur
Rahman @ Dilku not guilty and acquit him from the charges under Sections 342/
376/ 506 IPC and under Sec.6 of the POCSO Act. The accused person is set at
his liberty forthwith.

14. The accused person be released forthwith from the
judicial custody.

15. Given under my hand and the seal of this court on this
the 22" day of June, 2018.
