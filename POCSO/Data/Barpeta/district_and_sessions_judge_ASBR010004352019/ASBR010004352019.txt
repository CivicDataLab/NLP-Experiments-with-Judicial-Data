She exhibited her medical report as Ext.1 and Ext.1(1) &
1(2) are her signatures.
During her cross-examination, she stated that The age of the

victim might be 17 years.

8). Pinki Parbin [P.W.2] deposed in her evidence that informant is
her father and she knew the accused. She stated that incident took place before

7/8 months. She was having love affairs with the accused for last one year. She

Special POCSO 44 of 2019 Page5 of9
went to the house of accused alone without informing anybody and stayed in the
house of accused for 3/4 days. She slept with the mother of accused.

She further stated that accused did not do any bad work with her.
Thereafter, her father lodged the case. Police brought her to thana from the
house of accused and accused fled away from his house.

After that, Police examined her and sent her for her medical
examination. Police also got her statement recorded u/s 164 CrPC by the learned
Magistrate.

She exhibited her statement recorded u/s 164 CrPC as Ext.2 and
Ext.2(1), 2(2) & 2(3) are her signatures.

In her cross-examination, she stated that accused did not do
any bad work with her. She gave her statement before the learned Magistrate, as

tutored, by others. Accused did not kidnap her.

9). Rahijuddin [P.W.2] who is the informant of this case has
deposed that victim is his daughter and he knows the accused person after
lodging of this case. Incident took place before 7/8 months. Accused took her
victim daughter after having love affairs with her. He stated that he lodged this
case after 2/3 days of the incident, when he did not get his victim daughter.
Police recovered his victim daughter on the next day of lodging the FIR. Victim
told him that she went with the accused after having love affairs with him. He
put his thumb impression in the FIR and he do not know the contents of the FIR.

In his cross-examination, he stated that accused did not force

his victim daughter to go with him.

10). From a close perusal of the evidence, it is seen from the statement
of the victim (P.W.2) as well as the informant (P.W.3) who is the father of the
victim girl, that they did not support the alleged incident, in their evidence.

The Victim (P.W.2), who is star witness of the instant case deposed
in her evidence that she was having love affairs with the accused for last one
year and she went to the house of accused alone without informing anybody and
stayed there for 3/4 days. She further stated in her evidence that accused did not

do any bad work with her. The victim girl clearly stated in her cross-examination

Special POCSO 44 of 2019 Page6 of9
that accused neither kidnapped her nor do any bad work with her. She gave her
statement before the learned Magistrate as tutored by others.

Moreover, the informant (P.W.3) stated in his cross-examination
that accused did not force his victim daughter to go with him.

Thus, it is clearly indicated that victim girl had love affairs
with the accused person and she voluntarily went to the house of
accused. Her conduct clearly shows that the alleging incident narrated in the
FIR is totally false.

The conduct of victim clearly shows that she was a willing party
and the conduct of the victim is not found natural had she been abducted or
kidnapped by the accused person by force.

There is no material on record to hold that the accused
kidnapped and committed rape on the victim, to constitute offence
under Sections 365 IPC read with Section 4 of the Protection of
Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

11). To bring home the guilt of the accused under Section 365 of IPC
read with Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, it is
necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused induced the prosecutrix
or compelled her by force to go from any place; that such inducement was by
deceitful means; that such kidnapping or abduction took place with the intent
that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit intercourse and/or that the accused
knew it to be likely that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit intercourse, as a

result of her abduction or kidnapping.

12). On scrutinizing the evidence on record, considering the entire
aspect of the matter and evidence, produced by the prosecution, I am of the
considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish that the accused
kidnapped the victim and committed rape on her. Hence, accused is entitled to

acquittal under the benefit of doubt, which I accordingly do.

13). In the result, accused Rakibul Islam @ Rakibul Ali is
acquitted of the charge under section 365 of IPC read with Section 4 of

Special POCSO 44 of 2019 Page7 of 9
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him, on
benefit of doubt.
The bail bond stands discharged.

14). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 12" day of
September, 2019.

Dictated & corrected by me.
