The Medical Officer has not framed any opinion regarding the

age of the victim.
7. The father of the victim who is the informant of this case as PW3
has mentioned her age as 18 years at the time of occurrence. He has
deposed that without informing him the victim had gone to the house
of the accused. They loved each other. Thereafter the victim returned
home alone. Out of suspicion he lodged the F.Il.R against accused
person. After the occurrence the victim got married with another boy.
The matter was already settled by the ,Samaj'. He is not willing to
proceed the case.

In his cross examination he has admitted that at the time of

occurrence he was not at home. He was at Udmari. The F.l.R was
written by somebody else. He put his signature only. He does not know
what is written in the FIR.
8. The victim as PW1 has corroborated the statement of her father
by stating that on the date of occurrence she had gone to the house of
the accused without informing her father. But the accused and his
parents did not allow her to stay there. Without knowing the real fact
her father lodged the F.I.R. However, later on he came to know the
actual fact.

In her cross examination she has stated that just after the
occurrence she was married by Mufa Sheikh Ali by executing
Kabinnama. In the Kabinnama her age was mentioned as 18 years.
Prior to the occurrence she had love affairs with Rafiqul and she had
gone with him at her own will. The accused person did not do any illicit
act with her. She made the statement before the magistrate as tutored
by the police. At the time of occurrence her father was at Udmari and
4

without knowing the real fact he lodged the F.I.R. In fact no occurrence
took place as narrated in the F.I.R. Accused Rafiqul is not guilty.
9. On the basis of above facts and circumstances and the
evidences on record it is found that none of the prosecution witnesses
has supported the case of the F.I.R. Both the informant and the victim
have stated that at the time of occurrence her age was 18 years and
love affairs was going on in between the accused and the victim. The
victim has clearly stated that she had gone to the house of the accused
at her own will and accused did not do any illicit act with her. Hence, it
is crystal clear that the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt
of the accused person for any offence. Therefore, the accused person is
acquitted and set at liberty.
