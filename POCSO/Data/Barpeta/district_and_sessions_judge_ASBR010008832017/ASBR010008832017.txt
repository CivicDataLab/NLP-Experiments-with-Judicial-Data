being Barpeta PS Case No.2670/2015 under Section 366(A)/506/34 IPC read with

namely Chandrakanta Kalita almost completed the investigation of the case.
P.W.7 did not arrest accused Hafizur Rahman and he filed charge-sheet against

In his cross-examination, P.W.7 deposed that there is no

14). Chandan Kr. Kalita [P.W.8] deposed that on 21.10.2015, he
was working at Barpeta PS as SI of the police. On that day, officer in charge of
Barpeta PS Sri Amrit Kalita received and registered one case being Barpeta PS

Special POCSO 21 of 2017 Page 8 of 12
arrested accused Amir on 16.11.2015 and produced before the court. After he
collected the medical examination report of the victim, P.W.8 haded over the case
diary to O.C.Barpeta on his transfer on 29.12.2015.

In his cross-examination, P.W.8 deposed that the FIR was
lodged after 3 days of the incident but there was no explanation in the FIR which
was received at 5:00 PM by the O.C. He went to place of occurrence on
27.10.2015.

P.W.8 recorded the statement of witnesses near the place of
occurrence and witness Hanif Ali (P.W.3) was examined by him.

He denied that he did not record the statement of witness Hafizur

Rahman; that he did not investigate the case properly.

15). From a close perusal of the statement of the victim (P.W.1), who is
star witness of this instant case, it is seen that Jaman did not force her to go
with him in a vehicle and she willingly went with him. Then, a quarrel took place
between the accused persons and her in respect of a mobile handset. After that,
she filed this case as tutored by village people. She (P.W.1) clearly deposed that
she gave her statement before the learned Magistrate as tutored by Police.
Besides, she did not want to proceed this case.

At this point, she indicated the name of the accused person is
Jaman in her evidence as well as in her ejahar. She did not clearly indicate the
name of the main accused for whom, Police had filed the charge-sheet against
them.

P.W.2 namely Abdul Sattar who is the father of the victim has
stated that he did not see the alleged incident and he stayed at Barerbhitha, at
the time of incident. P.W.2 did not see whether her daughter forceful went with
accused or not ?

P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.5 deposed in their cross-examination that at
that time of incident, they were at Guwahati and they did not see by whom and
how, victim was kidnapped.

Hence, other witnesses of this case stayed at Guwahati and they
did not see the alleged incident.

Moreover, Medical Officer (P.W.6) did not find any injury marks on

Special POCSO 21 of 2017 Page 9 of 12
her body and P.W.6 admitted in medical examination report that victim was not
suffering from any physical or mental disability.

Thus, it is crystal clear that she willingly traveled with the accused
persons in a vehicle. The aforesaid Jaman also did not force her to go with him in
a vehicle and she willingly went with them.

Moreover, victim has not supported even the FIR (Ext.1) lodged

her herself.

16). In the result, I am constrained to hold that the evidence adduced
by the prosecution in support of its case is nothing shorter than mere conjectures
and suspicion. Consequently, the charge under Sections 366(A) of IPC read with
Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 is held to
be not proved against the accused Hafizur Rahman @ Habu and Amir Ali
beyond all reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the accused are found entitled to get
benefit of doubt, for which, the accused Hafizur Rahman @ Habu and Amir
Ali are acquitted on benefit of doubt under Section 366(A) of IPC read with
Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

17). On scrutiny of the evidence on record, it is seen that no case has
been made out against the accused Hafizur Rahman @ Habu and Amir Ali to
warrant his conviction under Section 366 (A) IPC read with Section 4 of The
Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012 beyond all reasonable
doubt, for which, I am of the opinion that the accused is entitled to acquittal on

benefit of doubt, which I accordingly do.

18). In the result, accused Hafizur Rahman @ Habu and Amir Ali
are acquitted of the charge under Section 366(A) of IPC read with Section 4 of
The Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him,
on benefit of doubt.

Their bail bond stand discharged.
