7). To decide the above point and sections of law, let us examine,
analyze and appreciate the evidence of the witnesses alongwith the relevant

documents.

Special POCSO 141 of 2019 Page3 of 7
Dr. Mamata Devi [P.W.1] deposed that on 14.05.2019, she was
working as Demonstrator, FAAMCH, Barpeta. On that day, victim Jesmina Khatun,
aged 12 years, was produced before her for her medical examination, but said
Jesmina Khatun refused to undergo her medical examination.

She exhibited her medical examination report as Ext.1 and
Ext.1(1) is the signature of said Jesmina Khatun and Ext.1(2) and 1(3) are her
signatures.

In her cross-examination, she deposed that as the patient
refused to for her medical examination, so she did not disclose the history of

offence.

8). Muzammel Ali [P.W.2] who is the informant of this case has
deposed that he knows the accused person of this case and victim is his
daughter, aged about 12-13 years. Incident took place before 4 months at about
10.00 PM. He stated that his victim daughter disappeared from his house. Then,
he searched her but could not find her. After passing of 20-22 days, he informed
police. Then, he received information from persons working at Guwahati, from
his village, that victim has been kept by the accused and other persons at
Guwahati.

After that, he brought back his victim daughter with the help of
police. Police sent her for her medical examination and got her statement
recorded under Section 164 Cr.PC.

In his cross-examination, he deposed that his victim daughter
kept on missing from his house and she has got some mental problem. He stated
that his victim daughter went herself to Guwahati and nobody took her to
Guwahati. He further deposed that people from Guwahati informed him as to her
where she stayed at Guwahati. He deposed that at present, she is missing from

her house. Accused did not do any bad work with her.

9). Jesmina Khatun [P.W.3] deposed in her evidence that
informant is her father and she knew the accused person of this case as he
belongs from same village. She stated that her parents scolded her and then, out

of anger, she went alone to Guwahati by bus and stayed at Adabari in the house

Special POCSO 141 of 2019 Page4 of 7
of her cousin brother Hajarat Ali for about 8 days. Then, her father came with
Police and took her back to home. Accused did not do any bad work with her.

Police examined her and sent her for her medical examination but
she refused to undergo medical examination. Police got her statement recorded
under Section 164 CrPC by the learned Magistrate. Ext.2 is her statement and
Ext.2(1) & 2(2) are her signatures. She gave her statement before the learned
Magistrate as tutored by Police.

During her cross-examination, she stated that her father
lodged this case after not finding her in his house. Accused did not take her and

did not do any bad work with her.

10). From a close perusal of the evidence, it is seen from the statement
of the victim (P.W.3), who is star witness of this instant case deposed in her
evidence that accused did not do any bad work with her. She stated that her
father lodged this case after not finding her in his house. P.W.3 deposed clearly
in her cross-examination that accused did not take her and did not do any bad
work with her. She voluntarily went to Guwahati when her parents scolded her.
She (P.W.3) refused to undergo for her medical examination.

Muzzamel Ali (P.W.2) who is the informant as well as father of the
victim girl stated in his cross-examination that his victim daughter voluntarily
went herself to Guwahati and accused did not do any bad work with her.

Hence, the conduct of the victim clearly shows that the alleging
incident narrated in the FIR is totally false.

The conduct of victim clearly shows that she voluntarily went to
Guwahati at the time of incident. The conduct of the victim is not found natural
had she been abducted or kidnapped by the accused person by force.

There is no material on record to hold that the accused
kidnapped and committed rape on the victim, to constitute offence
under Sections 365/376/506 IPC read with Section 4 of the Protection
of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

11). To bring home the guilt of the accused under Section 365/376 of
IPC read with Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012,

Special POCSO 141 of 2019 PageS of 7
it is necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused induced the
prosecutrix or compelled her by force to go from any place; that such
inducement was by deceitful means; that such kidnapping or abduction took
place with the intent that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit intercourse and/or
that the accused knew it to be likely that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit

intercourse, as a result of her abduction or kidnapping.

12). It is cardinal principal of criminal Law that prosecution case has to
stand on its own leg and offence has to be proved against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt.

13). On scrutinizing the evidence on record, considering the entire
aspect of the matter and evidence, produced by the prosecution, I am of the
considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish that the accused
kidnapped the victim and committed rape on her. Hence, accused is entitled to

acquittal under the benefit of doubt, which I accordingly do.

14). In the result, accused Marfat Ali is acquitted of the charge
under section 365/376 of IPC read with Section 4 of Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him, on benefit of doubt.

His bail bond stands discharged.

15). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 24% day of
September, 2019.
