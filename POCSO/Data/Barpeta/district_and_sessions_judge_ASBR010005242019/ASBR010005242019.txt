returned home. She did not tell the incident to anybody. She did not tell the

She exhibited her statement as Ext.2 and Ext.2(1) is her signature
recorded under Section 164 CrPC.

11). Shahida Parbin (PW5) has deposed that victim is her younger

12). From a close perusal of the statement of the victim (PW4), who is
star witness of this instant case, it is seen that she has deposed that On the
relevant date, she went out to paddy field to cut grass and suddenly accused
came towards her. Then, she started crying out of fear. After that, accused went
away. She clearly stated in her evidence that accused did not do any harm to her.
Accused did not do any bad work or gave any bad indication to her.

The informant (PW.5), who is the elder sister of the victim has
filed this case clearly stated in her evidence that accused did not do any bad
work or gave any bad indication to her victim sister at the time of incident and
she also did not know the content of the FIR.

Moreover, mother of the victim girl (PW.3) deposed in her
evidence that victim did not tell her anything regarding the incident. She heard
that accused threatened her daughter Amina when she went to cut grass.

Hence, there is no material on record to hold that the
accused attempted to commit rape on the victim by catching her to
constitute offence under Section 18 of Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

13). In the result, I am constrained to hold that the evidence adduced
by the prosecution in support of its case is nothing shorter than mere conjectures
and suspicion. Consequently, the charge under Sections 18 of the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 is held to be not proved against the
accused Gajibur Rahman beyond all reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the accused
is found entitled to get benefit of doubt, for which, the accused Gajibor
Rahman is acquitted on benefit of doubt under Section 18 of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, which I

accordingly do.

14). In the result, accused Gajibor Rahman is acquitted of the charge
under Section 18 of The Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012,
levelled against him, on benefit of doubt.

His bail bond stands discharged.
