was working at Barpeta P.S. as Women S.I. On that day, O/C of Barpeta PS

After taking charge of investigation, she arrested the accused on

investigation of the case is completed. Hence, she submitted the Charge-sheet
against the accused under Sections 500/506 IPC R/W section 8/12 of Special
POCSO Act.

She exhibited the charge sheet as Ext.6 and Ext.6(1) is her

Special POCSO case No. 103 of 2019 Page 10 of 14
signature.
In her cross-examination, she deposed that three persons
were accused as per the FIR including the present accused Mannan Ali. She did

not made Amela Khatun & Jaharul Islam as accused in this case.

14). Amela Khatun (D.W.1) has stated that she knows the accused
person and informant as well as victim of this case. At the time of incident,
accused was working at Andhra Pradesh and he came before 5 months to cast
his vote. Police arrested him after his arrival. She stated that no incident took
place in her residence as alleged in the FIR of the case. Her house is built with
â€˜Pat Khariâ€™ and tin. The house of victim is at a distance of about 2 bighas from
her house. Police did not go to their village in connection of this case.

D.W.1 stated that this case lodged falsely by Jesmina. Her son
also did not take obscene photo of the accused and victim. She has further
stated that they are having 8 nos of family members in her house and they are
stay all together.

In her cross-examination, she stated that she did not give
evidence in this case earlier. D.W.1 stated that victim has deposed falsely before
the Hon'ble Court that accused did bad work with her.

She denied that she has lodged false evidence before the Court to

defend the accused.

15). From the perusal of evidence of the victim, it is seen that P.W.2
who is the victim of this case deposed that the aunt of accused namely Amela
called her to their house saying that her daughter namely Rubida Khatun will also
go to school with her. When, she went to her house then the aunt of accused
locked the house from outside. At that time, accused did bad works with her on
the floor of the house and she tried to resist him, but he did not listen to her
protest. She stated that one Jahurul took obscene photo of both of them at that
time. After that, accused threatened her to kill if she disclose the incident to her
family members. P.W2 stated in her cross-examination that Amela who is the

mother of the accused is a mentally disturbed lady for last 4/5 years and there

Special POCSO case No. 103 of 2019 Page I1 of 14
are 8 members in the family of Amela and stayed together in the same house.
But the said Amela Khatun clearly deposed in her defence witness that accused
was working at Andhra Pradesh when the alleged incident occurred. Her
deposition did not indicate that she is a mentally disturbed lady as deposed by
the victim in her deposition.

Victim (P.W.2) deposed in her cross-examination that she
sustained injury on her body after the incident but she did not show the injury,
so sustained, to the doctor, at the time of examination.

Moreover, incident of this case took place on 13-02-2018 but FIR
was lodged on 24-02-2018. There is no mentioned of cause of delay in lodging
the FIR. Further, Investigating Officer namely Niva Phukhan (P.W.6) deposed in
her evidence that she could not trace out during investigation as to on whose
whatsapp, the alleged naked photo of the victim was uploaded, as alleged. She
did not seize hard copy of those photos.

Thus, the entire Prosecution case, seems to be doubtful. The
statement of the victim is not found to be believable and trustworthy. There is no
corroboration to the prosecution story that accused raped the victim on the
alleged date of incident at the house of D.W.1. Moreover, Prosecution side did not
examine the vital witness of it namely Amela Khatun, who allegedly called the
victim to her house, at relevant time, and pushed her inside her house where
accused allegedly raped her.

However, the said witness has been examined by the defence side
as D.W.1 and she has clearly deposed that accused was not even present, when
the said alleged incident took place. She further deposed that accused was

working at Andhra Pradesh at that time.

16). On scrutinizing the evidence on record, considering the entire
aspect of the matter and evidence, produced by the prosecution, I am of the
considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish that the accused
captured the obscene photo of the victim and committed rape on her. Hence,
accused is entitled to acquittal under the benefit of doubt, which I accordingly
do.

Special POCSO case No. 103 of 2019 Page 12 of 14
17). It is cardinal principal of criminal Law that prosecution case has to
stand on its own leg and offence has to be proved against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt.

18). In the result, accused Mannan Ali is acquitted of the charge
under section 365(C) of IPC read with Section 4 of Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him, on benefit of doubt.

His bail bond stands discharged.

19). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 04% day of
October, 2019.
