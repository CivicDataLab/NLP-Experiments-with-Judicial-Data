8. From the evidence of the prime witness i.e. the victim of the
case, it is seen that she knew the prime accused Saha Alam prior to the
incident. She clearly stated in her evidence that the said accused used to
visit her house prior to the incident. The accused persons are charged u/s
365/34 IPC r/w section 4 of POCSO Act.

9. Section 365 IPC demands that the accused must kidnap a
person by inducing her to go with them or for keeping that person secretly
and wrongfully confined.

10. However, there is no iota of evidence that accused kidnapped
the victim girl for secretly and wrongfully confined her. Rather, the victim
in her evidence-in-chief clearly stated that she voluntarily went with the
accused persons, to Goalpara, for traveling in their bike and they were
caught by police of Goalpara.

11. Moreover, the victim has further deposed that the accused
persons did not do any bad work or sexual activities with her, during her
stay, with them.

Special POCSO 41 of 2019 Page 7 of 9
13. It is cardinal principal of criminal Law that prosecution case
has to stand on its own leg and offence has not be proved against the
accused beyond reasonable doubt.

14. On scrutinizing the evidence on record, considering the entire
aspect of the matter and evidence, produced by the prosecution, | am of
the considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish that the
accused persons kidnapped the victim or committed penetrative sexual
assault on the victim. Hence, accused persons are entitled to acquittal
under the benefit of doubt, which | accordingly do.

15. In the result, accused Saha Alom & Somer Ali are
acquitted of the charge under section 365/34 IPC read with section 4 of
The Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled

against them, on benefit of doubt.

16. Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 12th day
