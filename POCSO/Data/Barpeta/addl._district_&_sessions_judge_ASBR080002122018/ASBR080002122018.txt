Discussions, Decision, and Reasons thereof

 

12. Perused the evidence of the witness and also gone
through the provision of law.

13. The learned defence counsel submitted that the case has
been filed due to misunderstanding of a fact and on suspicion. There is
absolutely no evidence against the accused person that he ever
induced the victim girl to go with him or by any manner. As both of

Page No. 6 of 11
-7-

them have love affairs as such, the victim girl willingly went with him
and stayed there. Moreover she went with the accused person 5 (five)
times prior to this incident. At present the victim girl is living with the
accused person at his house as husband and wife and they also
blessed by a child. Though the I/O has collected the birth certificate of
the victim but did not prove it as required under the provision of law
for which, the birth certificate could not be accepted. Considering the
above facts and circumstances, prays to acquit the accused person
from the liability of this case.

14. Per contra learned Addl. PP submits that from the
evidence of the witnesses it comes to light that on the day of incident
the accused person took away the victim girl and as such, he has
committed the offence charge thereunder and prays to pass the order

of conviction.

15. Considered the tenacious submission of the learned
counsel appearing for the accused and learned Addl. PP appearing for
the state. Also gone through the relevant materials.

16. PW 1 the informant stated that her daughter eloped with
the accused person on that day for which she lodged the FIR. Before
this incident too, she eloped with the accused person for 3 (three)
times. At present her daughter has been living with the accused person
at his house and out of their wedlock a child was born to them. PW 3
deposed that several times her grand daughter eloped with the
accused Rubul Ali and now she is living with him at his house. PW 4 is
the investigating officer who deposed that he seized the _ birth
certificate of the victim girl on being produced by the informant but he
did not inquire about the genuineness of the same by asking the
issuing authority.

17. PW 2 is the vital material witness of this case i.e. the
victim girl. She stated that she had love affair with the accused person
and on the day of incident she voluntarily went with him to his house.

Page No. 7 of 11
-8-

Thereafter they went to Bhella under Barpeta district and solemnized
marriage before the Kaji by executing Kabin-nama. At that time she
was 2 (tow) months pregnant. The victim girl also stated that prior to
this incident she eloped with the accused person for 5 (five) times.
This time also she got pregnant from the side of the accused person
and therefore she went with him. At present she is living with him as
husband and wife and they were blessed by a female child. The victim
girl also stated that the accused person did not use any force or
inducement upon her to go with him.

18. Now, on careful and dispassionate analysis of the
evidence of the prosecution witnesses, it appears that PW2 i.e. victim
girl loves the accused person prior to this incident. She in her
evidence categorically stated that she went with the accused person
on herâ€™ own volition. Moreover, at the time of incident she was
pregnant from the side of accused person. From her evidence it is also
seen that the accused person at any point of time did not induce or
compel her to go with him rather she willingly went with him and
solemnized marriage at the office of Kaji. The victim girl in her
statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C also stated that as she loves the
accused person for long time, and her mother did not agree to give
marry her to the accused, as such she went with him. The Investigating
Officer seized the birth certificate of the victim girl during the course of
investigation but he did not inquire the genuineness by asking its
issuing authority. Hence, the said birth certificate cannot be accepted
as per the provision of law. Moreover, the prosecution side has failed to
prove the birth certificate as required under the law . Mere exhibition of
document is not enough unless it is proved as required u/s 64 of
Evidence Act. In-spite of that the delay of lodging the FIR was not
mentioned by the complainant.

19. On perusal of Section 366 (A) IPC it appears that a person
can be convicted u/s 366 (A) IPC only if taking away or enticement is
proved. In the instant case the element of taking away on enticement
by accused with force or coercion is found absent. Moreover, the age of

Page No. 8 of 11
-9-

the victim girl is also not established in this case. The prosecution also
failed to establish the age of the victim girl at the relevant time with
credible document. Therefore, in order to sustain the charge under this
section the age of the victim must be proved by the prosecution. A
kidnapping per se may not lead to any inference as to what purpose or
what intent girl has been kidnapped. The intention for which a person
is kidnapped must be gathered from the circumstances attending prior
to or at the time of and subsequent to the commission of the offence.

20. In the instant case, no such inference can be drawn from
the evidence on record that accused kidnapped or compelled the girl to
go with him with a view to seduce to illicit intercourse or knowing it to
be likely that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. In the
course of her evidence the alleged victim girl has not made any such
allegation against accused. The inducement on the part of the accused
is seemingly absent in the instant case.

21. The another charge which was framed against the
accused person is Sec. 4 of POCSO Act, 2012. On perusal Sec. 4 of
POCSO Act and after going through the evidence available on record
particularly the evidence of the alleged victim it transpires that she
never stated anything against the accused person of the commission
of the penetrative sexual assault against her. From her evidence
nothing can even be inferred even remotely that accused had
committed the offence u/s 4 of POCSO Act. As it appears from the
evidence of the prosecution side, the age of the victim could not be
established that she was a minor at the time of happening of the
incident hence, the ingredients of section 4 POCSO Act, 2012 found
missing in the instant case.

22. In view of above, it can be safely concluded that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused person
beyond all reasonable doubt.

2S Accordingly, the accused Rubul Ali @ Adit is acquitted of

Page No. 9 of 11
-10-

the offences charged u/s 366 (A) IPC r/w Sec. 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and
set him at liberty forthwith.

24. The terms of bail bond of accused persons is extended for
a period of 6 (six) months from to-day as provided U/S 437(A) Cr.P.C.

Zo. A copy of this judgment be given to the _ District
Magistrate, Barpeta u/s 365 Cr.P.C.

26. The Spl. POCSO Case is disposed of accordingly.

27. Judgment is pronounced and delivered in the open Court
in presence of both the parties and | put my hand and seal of this Court
on this 14th day of October, 2019.
