Eusuf Ali Ahmed [PW2], who is the paternal uncle of
victim, deposed that on 19.09.2016 his niece Manjuwara came to his
house. On 23.09.2016 at around 8:00 PM, she went to nearby market. His

accused voluntarily and appeared at thana at her own will.

Defence declines to cross examine PW8.

Hafizur Rahman [PW9] stated that he knows the informant
and the victim, but does not know the accused. He does not know
anything about the incident.

Defence declines to cross examine PW9.

Asadul Ali [PW10] stated that he does not know the
informant, but he knows the accused. He also stated that he drove the
ALTO 800 vehicle. He was declared hostile at the instance of prosecution
Side.

In his cross examination by the prosecution side, he stated
among things that on the relevant day he picked up a girl from Kalgachia
near K. K. Pathak High School and dropped them at Simalaguri.

In his cross-examination by defence side he stated that police

Special POCSO 14 of 2018 Page 9 of 15
did not record his statement.

Hazarat Ali Ahmed [PW11], who is the I.0. of this case,
stated that on 24.09.2016 he was working at Kalgachia PS as In-charge.
One Yusuf Al Ahmed lodged FIR. Ext.2 is the FIR. He registered a case
being Kalgachia PS case No.726/2016 u/s 120(B)/366(A) IPC read with
section 4 of POCSO Act. Ext.2(2) is his signature.

On that day itself, he proceeded to the place of incident,
examined the relevant witness, drew the sketch map. Ext.4 is the sketch
map and Ext.4(1) is his signature. He also examined the complainant but
did not find the accused person, on that day.

On 14.10.2016 the victim herself came to police station. He
examined the victim and sent her for medical examination. He also got
her statement recorded by the learned Magistrate u/s 164 CrPC. During
investigation he seized the birth certificate of the victim girl vide seizure
list Ext.5. Ext.5(1) is his signature. He had seen the photocopy of the said
birth certificate today in the case record. He had given the original birth
certificate in the zimma of the mother of the victim. He collected the
medical report of the victim and submitted the charge sheet against the
accused person. Ext.6 is the charge sheet dated 08.12.2016. Ext.6(1) is
his signature.

In his cross-examination PW11 stated that he recorded
the statement of the victim in civil dress. Victim came alone. He did not
remember whether any female family members went with the victim at
the time of her medical examination. He did not seize any articles except
the birth certificate of the victim.

Witness Yusuf Ali Anmed (PW2) did not state before him that
there was love affairs between the accused and victim; that he heard the
sound of maruti vehicle, he could see one white colour maruti vehicle
went in front of his shop, after a while he came to know that accused has
kidnapped his niece in the maruti vehicle.

Witness Farida Khatun(PW3) did not state before him that she
and her husband came out after hearing the sound of maruti vehicle and
could see the maruti vehicle; that father of the victim telephone her

Special POCSO 14 of 2018 Page 10 of 15
husband.

At the time of incident victim was a college student. She was
the eldest child of the family.

He denied that he had not done the investigation as per law.

8. From the closed perusal of the evidence on record it is seen
that the victim claimed that she was under 18 years of age and the other
witnesses also stated and wanted to establish that she was less than 18
years of age at the time of incident. The 1.0. of the case (PW11) deposed
that he seized the birth certificate of the victim girl vide seizure list Ext.5.
But the prosecution side did not produce the said birth certificate during
trial of the case to determine age of the victim girl. Though the 1.0. found
the photocopy of the said birth certificate on the case record, but the
same is not admissible in evidence when the original was available with

the mother of the victim.

9. Further, the prosecution has relied on the evidence of M.O.
(PW1). But the M.O. namely, Dr. Mamata Devi, in her evidence opined that
victim was above 14 years and to know the exact age of the victim
radiological investigation are necessary.

10. Hence, from the above, it cannot be said with certainty that
victim was below 18 years of age at the time of evidence beyond all
reasonable doubt.

11. Now coming to charged sections in this case, it is seen that
the accused has been charged u/s 366 IPC alongwith section 4 of POCSO
Act. To bring home the guilt of the accused u/s 366 IPC, it is necessary for
the prosecution to prove that the accused induced the prosecutrix or
compelled her by force to go from any place; that such inducement was
by deceitful means; that such kidnapping or abduction took place with the
intent that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit intercourse and/ or that
the accused knew it to be likely that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit
intercourse, aS a result of her abduction or kidnapping.

Special POCSO 14 of 2018 Page 11 of 15
12. However, from the case in hand, it is seen that though the
victim stated that at the relevant time, she went to market and the
accused alongwith some unknown persons came in a maruti car and she
was taken in that car after gagging her mouth. It is hard to believe that, a
girl can be taken from the market in front of all the person, in the way, as
deposed by the victim. Moreover, there is none who had seen the accused
taking the victim in the said vehicle. The informant (PW2) deposed that he
came to know that the accused kidnapped his niece in the maruti car, but
he had not disclosed, as to who told him, that the accused had taken the
victim with him. All the witnesses, produced by the prosecution side, are
hearsay witnesses and nobody had seen the actual alleged kidnapping by
the accused. Further, the victim stated that she was kept in hotel and the
accused made physical relation with her forcefully. But in her cross-
examination she deposed that she was having love affairs with the
accused for last three years and she herself requested the accused to take
her with him, otherwise, she will die. Moreover, she has clearly admitted
that she did not state before the police that either she was kidnapped or
accused had done any bad works with her. No wonder, for this reason, the
M.O.(PW1), while writing the history of the patient, has written in her
medical examination report (Ext.1) that the victim told her that she was
having love affairs with the accused for last three years and she eloped
with him on 23.09.2016 and stayed at Howly for 5 days. Then she went to
Guwahati and Goalpara.

13. It is interesting to note here that though the informant and
his wife tried to hide that there was love affairs between the victim and
the accused of the case, but the mother of the victim Musstt. Hasina
Khatun (PW5) clearly admitted in her cross-examination that there was
love affairs between the accused and the victim of the case.

14, There is no evidence of inducement or threat to the victim at
the relevant time of the incident. Even it is on the record that the victim,
after her surrender before the thana, refused to go with her mother and

Special POCSO 14 of 2018 Page 12 of 15
the learned court below had directed to keep her in the State Home for
two days. The victim in her cross-examination admitted that she was at
State Home from 14.10.2016 to 18.10.2016 as she refused to go with her
mother. Even on 18.10.2016 she wanted to go with the accused.

15. The evidence of PW7,8,9 & 10 are of no use to the case of
prosecution side. PW8 even deposed that the victim was aged more than
18 years and she went to the accused voluntarily and appeared before the
thana at her own will. Last, but not least, it may be pointed out that the
victim was a student of BA 2nd semester at the time of incident and she
must have been more than 18 years of age, at the time of incident.
Further, the victim also has not implicated the accused in her statement
u/s 164 CrPC.

16. It is cardinal principal of criminal Law that prosecution case
has to stand on its own leg and offence has not be proved against the
accused beyond reasonable doubt.

17. On scrutinizing the evidence on record, considering the entire
aspect of the matter and evidence, produced by the prosecution, | am of
the considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish that the
accused kidnapped the victim. The victim in her deposition before the
court as well as in her statement under section 164 CrPC did not utter a
single word that accused had sexual relation with her forcibly. Hence,
accused is entitled to acquittal under the benefit of doubt, which |
accordingly do.

18. In the result, accused Al Masud Jahan @ Al Masud Hasan
@ Liku is acquitted of the charge under section 366 IPC read with
section 4 of The Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012,
levelled against him, on benefit of doubt.

Accused is on bail. The bail bond of accused is extended for
another 6(six) months from today as per provision of 437-A CrPC.
