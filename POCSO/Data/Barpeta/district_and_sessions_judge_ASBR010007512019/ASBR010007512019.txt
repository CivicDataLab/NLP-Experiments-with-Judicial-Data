DISCUSSION, DECISIONS AND REASONS THEREOF :

 

7). To decide the above point and sections of law, let us
examine, analyze and appreciate the evidence of the witnesses
alongwith the relevant documents.

Nilima Ahmed [P.W.1] has deposed that informant is her
husband and victim is her daughter. She has stated that victim age is
about 9 years at present. Incident took place before 4 years. At the
time of alleged incident, she was doing her household works. Accused
was doing painting work at her house.

She stated that drop of colour fell on the person of her
daughter, for which she cried. She rushed to her and found that colour
fell on her body in good quantity. She entered into altercation with the
accused person. People gathered and assaulted the accused. She
stated that accused did not touch body of her victim daughter. After
that, her husband lodged this case.

In her cross-examination, she stated that the matter is
settled between both the sides at present. Accused did not open cloth
of her victim daughter.

8). The Victim [P.W.2] deposed in her evidence that she
knew the accused person. Accused did painting works at her house.
She stated that accused threw colour on her and she cried.

She further stated that accused did not open her cloth and
did not touch her body. She narrated the whole incident to her mother.

She gave her statement recorded under Section 164 CrPC
by learned Magistrate.

P.W.1 exhibited her statement as Ext.1 and Ext.1(1),
1(2) and 1(3) are her signatures.

During her cross-examination, she deposed that
she gave her statement as told by Police.

Special POCSO 68 of 2019 Page 4 of 7
9). Jakir Ali [P.W.3] deposed in his evidence that he lodged
this case. Victim is his daughter. He stated that he was not present at
the time of incident and came to his house after the incident. He found
hue and cry in his house and on being asked, he was informed that
painting colour fell on her victim daughter when the accused was doing
painting works at her bathroom. Then, her daughter cried.

He stated that accused did not do any bad work with her
daughter and he did not open her cloth. Public threatened the accused
and he lodged the case.

He exhibited the FIR as Ext.2 and Ext.2(1) and Ext.2(2) are
his signature.

In his cross-examination, he stated that he lodged this
case due to the pressure put on her by the public.

10). From a close perusal of the evidence, it is seen that all
the witnesses including victim deposed clearly in their
evidence that accused did not touch her body and did not do
any bad work with the victim girls.

Thus, it is clear from the version of the all witnesses, that
accused did not attempt to commit rape on the victim girl. This case
was lodged with a false story by her father against the accused person.

Moreover, the informant namely Jakir Ali (P.W.3) also
deposed in his cross-examination that he lodged this case due to
the pressure put on him by the public.

All the witnesses did not support the content of the FIR of
this case and simply stated that accused had fallen colour on the
victim girl when he (accused) was doing painting works at her
bathroom.

11). Hence, | am constrained to hold that the evidence
adduced by the prosecution in support of its case is nothing shorter
than mere conjectures and suspicion. Consequently, the charge under
Sections 18/8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
2012 is held to be not proved against the accused Hasen Ali beyond all

Special POCSO 68 of 2019 Page 5 of 7
reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the accused is found entitled to get
benefit of doubt, for which, the accused Hasen Ali is acquitted on
benefit of doubt under Section 18/8 of the Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

12). On scrutiny of the evidence on record, it is seen that no
case has been made out against the accused Hasen Ali to warrant his
conviction under Section 18/8 of the Protection of Children From Sexual
Offences Act, 2012 beyond all reasonable doubt, for which, | am of the
Opinion that the accused is entitled to acquittal on benefit of doubt,
which | accordingly do.

13). In the result, accused Hasen Ali is acquitted of the
charge under Section 18/8 of the Protection of Children From Sexual

Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him, on benefit of doubt.

14). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 30%
day of July, 2019.
