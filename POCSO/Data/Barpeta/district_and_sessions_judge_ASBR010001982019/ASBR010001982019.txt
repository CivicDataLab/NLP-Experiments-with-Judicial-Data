DISCUSSION, DECISIONS AND REASONS THEREOF

 

7. To decide the above point and sections of law, let us
examine, analyze and appreciate the evidence of the witnesses
alongwith the relevant documents.

PW. 1-Khalida Ahmed, who is the victim of this case,
deposed that the incident took place three years before. She
has stated that she had love affairs with the accused person
and she voluntarily went with the accused person, at that time,
from her hostel mess. She admitted that after 2/3 months, she
came back to her parent house. She has further sated that the
accused did not enter into physical relation with her. She made
her statement before the police and magistrate out of
ignorance. Now, she has been staying with the accused person
as husband-wife and a girl child (aged about 13 months) was

5

born out of their wedlock. PW.1 further admitted that police
sent her to Medical Officer for medical examination and she
gave her statement under Section 164 CrPC before the
Magistrate. Ext. 1 is her statement and Ext. 1(1) & 1(2) &
1(3) are her signatures.

PW-2 Suleman Ali Ahmed, who is the informant as
well as the father of the victim, deposed that incident took
place three years before. His daughter Khalida Ahmed went
with the accused person from her mess. He has stated that
they had love affairs at the time of incident. Now, she is
staying with the accused person as husband and wife. He
deposed before the court that he did not want to proceed with
the case. PW2 exhibited his FIR as Ext.2 wherein Ext.2(1) &
2(2) are his signatures.

8. From a close perusal of evidence on record it is seen
that victim knew the accused prior to the incident. Now coming
to the charge under Section 366A IPC against the accused, the
victim stated that on the relevant date, first time she was
reluctant to go with the accused person but later on, she went
voluntarily with the accused person from her hostel mess. PW2
Suleman Ali Ahmed submitted before the court in his evidence
that he did not want to proceed the case as his daughter and
accused Imran Hussain has been staying as husband and wife.
P.W.2 also deposed that victim went with the accused

voluntarily.
Thus, it is seen that victim voluntarily went with the

accused person and now they have been living as husband-wife
and a girl child has been born out of their wedlock.

9. Regarding the charge under Section 4 of POCSO Act,
it is seen that the victim did not state before the court in her
evidence that she was raped by the accused. She rather
confirmed before the court that she went with the accused
person voluntarily and he (accused person) did not enter into
physical relation with her.

10. It is cardinal principal of criminal Law that
prosecution case has to stand on its own leg and offence has to
be proved against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

11. On scrutinizing the evidence on record, considering
the entire aspect of the matter and evidence, produced by the
prosecution, | am of the considered opinion that the
prosecution has failed to establish that the accused kidnapped
the victim or committed rape on the victim. Hence, accused is
entitled to acquittal at least under the benefit of doubt, which |

accordingly do.

12. In the result, accused Imran Hussain is acquitted of
the charge under section 366(A) IPC read with section 4 of The
Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled

against him, on benefit of doubt.

13. Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this
20 day of May, 2019.
