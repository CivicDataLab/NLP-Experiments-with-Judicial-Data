his house. While Anowar opened the door she found accused Ajijul @ Aju and

Examination of the accused person under section 313 Cr.P.C. is dispensed with.
5: Point for determination:-

Whether on 16-07-2016 at about 3.30 P.M. the accused person committed
penetrative sexual assault on the victim who is the minor daughter of the
informant ?

Decision and reasons thereof:

7. In this case the prosecution has examined only two witnesses. One is the
informant and other is the victim.

8. The informant as PW1 has deposed that on the day of occurrence she has
gone to see water of river Brahmaputra. The victim was in the house of the
accused person. The father of the accused is her maternal uncle. After seeing the
water she had gone to the house of the accused and saw several persons
gheraowed his house. On being asked the father of the accused replied that
nothing was happened. But the villagers demanded to file the case. Before arrival
of the victim the villagers wrote an FI.R and took her signature. After sometime
while she asked the victim about the occurrence she replied that nothing was
happened. Police produced the victim before the Magistrate for recording her
statement and also medically examined her. Accused Ajijul already married the
victim.

9. The victim as P.W.2 has deposed that on the date of occurrence her
mother had gone to see water and she had gone to the house of her grand
father Jainal. Accused Anowar is the son of Jaynal. While she was in the house of

the accused some people gheraowed his house. She could not talk with her
3

mother. The villagers compelled her mother to file the case. Later on, she
informed her mother that no occurrence took place. Police came and took her
before the Magistrate. The Magistrate recorded her statement. She was
examined by the medical officer also. She made the statement before the
Magistrate as tutored by the police. Ext.2 is the said statement. Now she got
married with accused Ajijul. Anowar did not do any offence.
10. â€˜After going through the evidences of the prosecution witnesses,and the
statement of the victim recorded U/S 164 Cr.P.C it is found that no way the victim
has stated that the accused person committed rape on her. In her statement
recorded U/S 164 CrP.C she has stated that the accused Ajijul @ Azijur
committed rape on her . The victim has not made a single whisper that accused
Anowar committed any rape or sexual assault on her. In her statement recorded
u/s 164 CrP.C also she has not stated that accused Anowar committed rape on
her. She made the allegation against Ajijul. But now Ajijul married her and the
charge-sheet was also submitted against accused Ajijul showing him Juvenile
Conflict with Law.
11. Under such circumstances it is clear that the prosecution has failed to
prove the guilt of the offence against Anowar Hussain. Therefore, the accused
person is acquitted and set at liberty.
12. Bail bond executed by the accused person and the surety are extended
for another period of six months from the date of this judgment under section
437-A Cr.P.C.
