(4) At present, victim's age is above 16 years and below 18 years.

P.W.1 exhibited her medical report as Ext.1 and Ext.1(1) is her
signature.

During her cross-examination, she stated that she opined the
age of victim on the basis of X-report and has mentioned the X-ray plate No. in

her report. But there is no X-ray plate before the court.

8). The Victim [P.W.2] deposed in her evidence that informant is
her father and she knows the accused person and he is not from her village.
Incident took place about 9 months ago. She went for tuition at about 3 PM from
her house. Then, she went to the house of accused situated at Bahmura. It took

one hour to reach his house by tempo and she went alone and voluntarily to the

Special POCSO 127 of 2019 Page5 of 10
house of accused due to love affairs with him but at that time, he was not
present at his house. Then, the family members of accused handed over her to
Child Line. They recorded her statement. Commissioner, CWC recorded her
statement. Then, her father brought her to their house from there after taking
her zimma and her father lodged this case.

Police examined her and sent her to doctor for her medical
examination. After that, Police brought her before the learned Magistrate for
recording her statement under Sections 164 CrPC.

She exhibited her statement vide Ext.2 and Ext.2(1) & 2(2) are her
signatures recorded under Section 164 CrPC

In her cross-examination, she stated that she had love affairs
with the accused person prior to the incident. She went to the house of accused
voluntarily. The family members of the accused handed over her to CWC as she
was below 18 years of age. Accused does not know anything about the incident
as he was not present at the time of incident, when she went there. She told
before CWC that she was having love affairs with the accused and she gave her
statement before learned Magistrate as tutored by her father and police.

She further stated that accused was not involved with the alleged

offence of this case as he was not present at the time of incident.

9). Nur Hussain [P.W.3] who is the informant of this case has
deposed in his evidence that victim is his daughter. Incident took place about 8/9
months ago. Victim was studying at Class IX, at the time of incident. She went
for her tuition, but she did return home. Then, he searched her and heard at late
night that she is staying at the house of the accused. After that, he went there
and they handed over the victim to the Child Line office. Then, he took zimma of
the victim from the office of Child Line. Thereafter, he lodged the case.

He exhibited the FIR as Ext.3 and Ext.3(1) & 3(2) are his
Signatures. He further stated that his victim daughter told that she was asked to
go to the house of accused, but accused was not present at his house.

In his cross-examination, he lodged the case due to anger as
his victim daughter went to the house of the accused without telling him. Victim

did not tell him anything about the incident, but she narrated the incident to her

Special POCSO 127 of 2019 Page6 of 10
mother. He lodged the case due to suspicion against the accused.

10). Palu Khan [P.W.4] stated that he did not know the accused
person but he knew the informant and victim of this case. Incident took place
about 7/8 months ago.

P.W.4 deposed that he went to the Child Line office alongwith the
informant to bring back the victim girl. Victim told that she went alone to the
house of accused. From there she was handed over to Child Line.

In his cross-examination, he stated that he did not have
personal knowledge about the incident except the fact that he went with the

informant to bring back the victim from the office of Child Line.

11). From a close perusal of the evidence, it is seen from the statement
of the victim (P.W.2), who is star witness of this instant case deposed in her
evidence that she had love affairs with the accused person prior to the incident
and she went to the house of accused voluntarily, on the day of alleged incident.
After that, the family members of the accused handed over her to C.W.C as she
was below 18 years of age.

The victim girl (P.W.2) clearly stated in her cross-examination that
accused did not know anything about the incident as he was not present at the
time of incident, when she went there. She (P.W.2) asserted that accused is not
involved with the alleged offence of this case.

Moreover, She (P.W.2) deposed the same statement before C.W.C
that she was having love affairs with the accused. She gave her statement before
learned Magistrate as tutored by her father and police.

Thus, it is clearly established that victim girl went to the house of
accused person voluntarily as she did not make any statement against the
accused before CWC. Her conduct clearly shows that the alleging incident
narrated in the FIR is totally false.

Moreover, her father who is the informant of this case had lodged
the case due to anger as his victim daughter went to the house of the accused

without telling him. He lodged the case due to suspicion against the accused.

Special POCSO 127 of 2019 Page7 of 10
Further, P.W.4 namely Palu Khan who is the independent witness
of this case, deposed in his cross-examination that he did not have personal
knowledge about the incident but he went with the informant to the Child line
Office to bring the victim.

The conduct of victim clearly shows that she voluntarily went to
the house of accused at the time of incident. The conduct of the victim is not
found natural had she been abducted or kidnapped by the accused person by
force.

There is no material on record to hold that the accused kidnapped
and committed rape on the victim, to constitute offence under Sections 365/506
IPC read with Section 4 of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act,
2012.

12). To bring home the guilt of the accused under Section 365/506 of
IPC read with Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012,
it is necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused induced the
prosecutrix or compelled her by force to go from any place; that such
inducement was by deceitful means; that such kidnapping or abduction took
place with the intent that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit intercourse and/or
that the accused knew it to be likely that the prosecutrix may seduced to illicit

intercourse, as a result of her abduction or kidnapping.

13). However, from to discussion made herein above, it is crystal clear
that victim went to the house of accused person voluntarily. There is no evidence

of inducement or threat to the victim at the relevant time of incident.

14). On scrutinizing the evidence on record, considering the entire
aspect of the matter and evidence, produced by the prosecution, I am of the
considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to establish that the accused
kidnapped the victim and committed rape on her. Hence, accused is entitled to

acquittal under the benefit of doubt, which I accordingly do.

15). In the result, accused Sanowar Hussain is acquitted of the

Special POCSO 127 of 2019 Pages of 10
charge under Sections 365/506 of IPC read with Section 4 of Protection
of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him, on
benefit of doubt.

His bail bond stands discharged.

16). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 04%" day of
October, 2019.
