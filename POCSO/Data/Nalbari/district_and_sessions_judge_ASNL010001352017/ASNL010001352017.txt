Cr.P.C and accused plea is total denial however he declined to

POINTS FOR DETERMINATIONS ARE:-

i. Whether accused Rejaul Alam committed house
trespass by entering into the house of informant on
10/12/16 at 5.30 PM with intent to commit rape
sexual assault on Sonia Parbin ?

ii. Whether accused on the same date, time and place
out dressed the modesty of Sonia Parbin ?

lil. Whether on the same date, time and _ place
voluntarily caused hurt on Sonia Parbin and
informant?

iv. Whether on the same date, time and place make
attempt to commit rape upon Sania Parbin ?

V. Whether accused on the same date, time and place
committed sexual assault on Sonia Parbin who is
under the age of 18 years ?

5. | have heard argument of learned counsel for both sides.
Learned Special Public Prosecutor submitted that informant
substantiated her statement made in the ejahar and victim girl
evidence pointed that accused persons sexually assaulted them
and prosecution beyond all reasonable doubt fairly able to
establish the case against the accused.

6. Countering the same learned defence counsel made
submission that prosecution failed to establish the charge against
the accused beyond all reasonable doubt and there is
contradiction in the statement of PW-1 & victims and no injury was
found on the right ear of the informant as per medical report and if
accused assaulted her with an iron rod she would have suffered
serious injury. He further submitted that the reason for not lodging
the ejahar on the same date of incident when Mukalmua PS is just
4 of 11

near to the Mukalmua PHC and she visit the doctor on the date of
incident and therefore delay in filing the ejahar caste doubt in the
prosecution case. Moreso, all the independent witnesses of the
prosecution goes against the prosecution and PW-6 who is living
with in the same compound with informant when reached house
immediately after the incident hearing the same did not see any
incident and PW-1 also not disclose any fact to her.

DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASON THEREOF:

 

7. In a proceeding under Protection of Children from Sexual
Offence Act presumption is drawn u/s-29 of the Act is that where
there is an allegation of commission of offence u/s-3, 5, 7 & 9 of
the Act, the special court shall presume that such person has
committed or abated or attempted to commit the case as case
may be unless the contrary is proved. This being the position for
trial of offence under POCSO Act, now let me scrutinized the
evidence on record whether evidence on record established the
fact alleged against the accused establish the case against the

accused or not.

8. PW-1 & PW-2 are the medical Officer. PW-1 examined
Chafila Khatun (Sabila Khatun), informant on 10/12/16 at about 5
pm. On that day he was working as senior medical and health
officer at Mukalmua PHC. On examination he found one abrasion
posterior part of left ear. Fresh bleeding present on left ear. Size 1
cm X 0.5 cm X 0.25 cm. Injury is simple caused by blunt weapon.
He received police requisition for medical examination on
20/12/2016.

9. In cross, he stated patient was not escorted by any police.
This type of injury can be sustained due to fall on hard substances.
On scrutiny it is seen from Ext-1, medical report of Sabila Khatun,
PW-1 examined Sabila on 10/12/16 at 5 pm and requisition for
medical examination from police issued on 20/12/16 that means
5 of 11

after examination police issued medical requisition to collect
medical report.

10.  PW-2 is another Medical Officer. He stated on 20/12/16 he
examined Miss Runa Laila and Miss Sonia Parbeen and on
examination found no any injury. Only injured reported body pain
and he examined them in connection with Doulasal O.P GD Entry
No.427/16 dated 20/12/16.

11. | have scrutinized the record, Ext-4 is the ejahar. PW-3,
Chafila Khatun, informant lodged ejahar before O/C, Mukalmua P.S
and Mukalmua PS. registered a case vide Mukalmua PS Case
No.428/16 u/s-448/354/376/511/325/34 IPC. Ejahar was not placed
before In-charge Doulashal O.P., under such circumstance GD
Entry of Doulashal O.P 427/16 dated 20/12/16 is in connection with
present case is not coming out clearly. Ext-7 is the sketch map.
PW-8 is the I/O of the case and in sketch map he refers Mukalmua
PS Case No.428/16. Statement of PW-8 also revealed that on
receipt of the ejahar from Chafila Khatun by O/C Mukalmua PS,
Mukalmua PS case No-428/16 was registered. There is nothing
coming out from the testimony of PW-8 to connect Doulasal O.P
GD Entry No.427/16 with present case. PW-8 not stated he took
victim to hospital in reference to Doulasal GD entry in connection
with present case. There is no medical report available on record
on the examination of Sonia Parbeen and Runa Laila on 10/12/16
either from Mukalmua PHC or at Doulasal MPHC. Moreso, there is
no injury found on the body of Sonia Parbeen and Runa Laila as
per evidence of PW-2, M.O. of the case.

12. As revealed from Ext-4 ejahar, incident was took place at 5-
30 pm. PW-3 is the informant. Her statement before the court is
that incident was took place at 5-30 pm. Ext-1 medical report of
PW-3 Chafila (Safila) and statement of PW-3 pointed he examined
Chafila (Safila) at 5 pm. If statement of PW-1 made before the
court and in her ejahar and her statement recorded u/s-164 Cr.P.C
6 of 11

is perused and taken into consideration, it goes to show that
incident was took place at 5-30 pm, then Doctor examined her at
5 pm that too in connection with the injury sustained in the
incident alleged in Ext-4 does not derived confidence, because her
statement pointed Mukalmua PHC is not adjacent to her house.
Her statement further pointed she was unconscious for about
10/15 minutes after the incident. Thereafter regained
consciousness and then heard about the incident from her
daughter and then she was taken to hospital. Thus, if incident was
took place at 5 pm, according to her statement she was
unconscious till 5.10 to 5.15 pm then she heard about the incident
from her daughter, then time is about 5-20/25 PM and then she
was taken to hospital. Even if it is presumed that Mukalmua PHC is
near to her house then also it takes 5 minutes to take the patient
to the hospital and at no point it could be at 5 pm for the
examination of PW-1 for the present incident.

13. Next point is that PW-3 Chafila (Sabila), PW-4 Runa Laila,
PW-7 Sonia Parbeen deposed accused assaulted their mother by
rod on her right ear. PW-3 deposed she was assaulted by accused
with a rod on her right ear. PW-4 & PW-7 deposed accused
assaulted their mother with a rod on her right ear. Rod is heavy
blunt weapon. If accused assaulted her with a rod on her right ear
then injury must have been serious and it is on her right ear and
not abrasion on left ear and doctors found injury on her left ear
not right ear. Thus Ext-l1 cannot be considered as medical
examination report of the Chafila Khatun in respect of incident
narrated by her and Ext-1 injury report failed to substantiate
prosecution plea that accused has caused injury on the left ear of
Chafila by assaulting her with an iron rod.

14. PW-3 deposed when she came forward to restrained
accused from attacking her daughter, Runa Laila, accused gave
one blow on her right ear with an iron rod and she became
unconscious and after 10/15 minutes she regained her sense and
7 of 11

then her younger daughter, Sonia Parbin told her that accused
also held her hair, pressed her breast and her daughter was taken
to Doulasal PHC and she was taken to Mukalmua PHC and on the
next day she lodged ejahar. But Ext-2 medical report does not
point Runa Laila and Sonia Parbin were taken to Doulasal PHC on
the date of incident. She did not hand over any medical
documents to the I/O during investigation in respect of providing
treatment to her daughter Runa Laila, Sonia Parbin on the date of
incident i.e on 10/12/16. PW-3 stated in cross Runa Laila is her
second child and her first child is a son, aged about 22 years

15. PW-3 informant Chafila Khatun deposed incident was took
place on 10/12/16 at about 5/5-30 pm and at that time she was
present in her room. She stated when she wanted to go to her
kitchen she heard shouting of her daughter, Runa Laila and went
towards her kitchen. Her this statement pointed when incident
was took place she was present in her room and she came from
her room when she heard shouting of her daughter, Runa Laila. In
Ext-4 ejahar PW-3 mentioned assault on Runa Laila not disclosed
and it is made after lodging the ejahar as such, this piece of
evidence is not believable beyond all reasonable doubt.

16. PW-4 Runa Laila deposed on the date of incident after
completion of the examination at 3 pm reached home. Thereafter,
changed her clothes, became fresh and when proceeded towards
Kitchen which is about 20 ft distance from their main house,
accused entered running from his house and entered into their
courtyard, hold her hair tried to drag her, pressed her breast,
called her prostitute and when she cried her sister and mother

came.

17. PW-7 is sister of PW-4 and daughter of PW-1. Her statement
is that she and her sister reached home from school and when she
was going towards kitchen with her sister Runa Laila to take rice
and at that time her mother was cooking food in the kitchen and
8 of 11

accused wanted to assault her and her sister. Her mother
restrained accused and then accused assaulted her mother with
rod. Thereafter, dragged her towards gate holding her hair and
pressed her breast and she became senseless.

18. When statement of PW-3, PW-4 and PW-7 perused together
it goes to show that they have gave their own version of the
incident. PW-3 stated she was in her room and wanted to go to the
kitchen. PW-7 stated at the time when incident was took place her
mother was already in the kitchen. PW-4 did not state where from
her mother and sister came. PW-7 claimed that she and her sister
together proceeded towards kitchen to take rice. But PW-4 claimed
she was going alone in the kitchen. PW-4 & PW-3 stated accused
first attacked PW-3 but PW-7 stated accused first assaulted her.

19. PW-4 stated accused first attacked her then attacked her
mother and lastly attacked her sister i.e one after another. She
stated when accused attacked her mother, she became
unconscious. Accused caught her sister hair and squeezed her
breast and called her prostitute. She stated hearing her hue and
cry village people rushed to their house and then accused left
their home and her mother lodged case. Her cross stated she is
not married but she admitted that she eloped with one Abdul
Mazid. Her date of birth is 19/01/2001. Accused is her cousin
brother, son of her Bardeuta i.e elder brother of her father. When
statement of PW-3, PW-4 & PW-7 read together it is seen that PW-7
made different chronological order of the incident. Her statement
is that when she and her sister, Runa Laila proceeded to take rice
their mother was cooking rice in the kitchen. Accused assaulted
her and her sister. Her mother came to restrained accused.
Accused assaulted her mother with an iron rod. Thereafter, held
her hair, dragged her towards the gate, and squeezed her breast.
She became unconscious and stated that accused also wanted to
assault her sister but could not succeeded. Her statement pointed
the story stated by PW-3 & PW-4 with regard to holding of Runa
9 of 11

Laila and squeezing her breast by accused contradicted by their
own daughter and sister PW-7 Sonia Parbin. She specifically stated
that accused failed to assault her sister. Thus statement of PW-3 &
PW-4 with regard to sexual assault on PW-4 is not established. PW-
3's version pointed she did not witness incident of assault on PW-
7. PW-7 did not state she disclose incident to her mother when she
regained consciousness. According to PW-7 mother witnessed the
incident of assault on her but her mother statement does not
revealed the same. Therefore, the story of sexual assault on PW-7
does not inspire confidence to the prosecution case. The cross-
examination of PW-4 & PW-7 pointed that accused is their cousin
brother, there is an iron gate and there was a fencing and
neighboring people rushed to their house immediately on hearing
cry for their help.

20. PW-6, Md. Dilbar Ali is residing in the same campus where
PW-3, PW-4 & PW-7 live. His statement is that on the date of
occurrence in the evening which is at a distance of two 'tar' from
his house while he was fishing, Diljan informed him that quarrel
took place at his house. He rushed to the house but he did not
notice anything. His evidence clearly pointed he and Chafila reside
in the same house. PW-3, PW-4 & PW-7 evidence pointed
neighboring people rushed to their house instantly hearing their
cry. But when PW-6 came to their house he did not notice
anything. PW-3, PW-4 & PW-7 evidence do not reveal that they
disclosed incident to any villager. Statement of I/O also not
pointed taking of any evidence of neighboring people. PW-5 who is
another neighbour of the PW-3, PW-4 & PW-7 also not witness any
incident and only heard about taking place of quarrel. Therefore,
the story stated by PW-3, PW-4 and PW-7 does not inspire
confidence in view of the testimony of PW-6 who being one of the
resident of same compound when reached home soon after the

incident did not witness any unnatural events circumstances.

21. In view of the aforesaid discussion, | come to my definite
finding that prosecution evidence is not sufficient enough to hold
accused Rejaul guilty of committing of offence u/s
448/354/323/376/511 IPC and section 8 of the POCSO Act and |
hold prosecution failed to bring home the charge u/s-
448/354/323/376/511 IPC and section-8 of the POCSO Act beyond
all reasonable doubt and accused entitled to benefit of doubt.

22. Inthe result accused Rejaul Alam acquitted form the charge
u/s-448/354/323/376/511 IPC and section-8 of the POCSO Act and

set at liberty.

23. However, his bail bonds remain stands for 6 months u/s-
437-A CrPC.

Judgment is given under my hand and seal of this court on
this the 18" day of June, 2019.
