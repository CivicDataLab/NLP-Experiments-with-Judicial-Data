DECI SION AND REASONS THEREOF
8. PW-1 Smt. Tuni Das, mother of the victim, in her evidence
deposed that about 4-5 years back, the victim left school after reading upto
class VIII and presently victim is aged about 18 years. The victim went to the

house of her 2"? daughter Buli Das for stay. While she was staying for there

about three months, somebody has informed her that accused Pramod Das

Spl. (P) Case No. 53/2017 Page 2 of 5
kept the victim as wife. On this out of anger, she lodged FIR at Sivasagar PS.
After filling of this FIR, police brought back her daughter and on asking she
reported that accused did not keep her as wife and that she filed the FIR
wrongly. As such she is not willing to prosecute this case by adducing further
evidence. In her cross-examination she admitted that she cannot say about
the contents of the FIR. She cannot say who wrote the FIR. She has no

objection in acquittal of the accused from this case.

9. PW - 2 the victim L in her evidence deposed that presently she is
aged about 18 years. In the last Durga Puja she went to the house of her 2"
sister Buli Das for stay. While she was staying there about one month,
somebody has informed her mother that accused Pramod Das kept her in his
house as wife. On this without asking her about the incident, her mother lodged
FIR at Sivasagar PS. After filling of this FIR, police brought back her to her
paternal home and on asking she reported that accused did not keep her as
wife. Accused being elder brother of her brother-in-law was simply joking that
he will marry her. Accused did not misbehave her while she stayed at the house
of elder sister. In her cross-examination the victim has admitted that she used
to call the accused as brother-in-law. Accused used to share same court yard

with her sister. Except joking accused did nothing with her.

10. PW-3 Smt. Buli Das, elder sister of the victim, in her evidence
deposed that accused Pramod Das is the elder brother of her husband and live
with them in joint family. About 4-5 months back, victim came to her house for
Stay to look after her infant child. During stay of the victim in her house, while
joking accused used to say her that he will marry the victim. On this her mother
without asking anybody, lodged an FIR. After filling of this FIR, police took the
victim from her house and handed over to her mother. Accused never

misbehaved with victim.
11. From the above evidence on record, it appears that due to

Spl. (P) Case No. 53/2017 Page 3 of 5
misunderstanding PW 1 lodged the FIR against the accused and after filing of
this FIR, police brought back the victim. From the evidence of PWs it appears
victim went to look after the infant child of her sister and that during stay of the
victim in the house of P.W.3, accused while joking uttered that he will marry
the victim. On hearing this, without asking anybody, PW 1 lodged the FIR. From
the evidence of P.W.2 and P.W.3 it depicts that accused neither kept confined
the victim not misbehaved the victim in any manner. From the above evidence
as discussed, it is clear that there was no material whatsoever regarding

penetrative sexual assault by the accused or of criminal intimidation.

12. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the ingredients of charge U/S 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and Section
506 IPC against the accused. As such, accused Pramod Das is acquitted from
the charges U/S 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and Section 506 IPC and set at liberty
forthwith.

13. Issue release order to Superintendent District Jail, Sivasagar
forthwith for release of the accused from Jail. As the accused is in Jail, no order
is passed U/S 437-A Cr.P.C.

14. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to
DLSA for granting compensation U/S 357 A Cr.P.C.

15. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

16. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of

on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 22" day of
February, 2018 Sivasagar.
