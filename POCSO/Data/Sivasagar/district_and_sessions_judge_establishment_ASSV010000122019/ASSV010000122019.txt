7. PW 1 Sri M. Chetia the informant as well as father of the victim
and PW 3, Smt. A Chetiya, mother of the victim in their evidence deposed that
at the relevant time of incident victim was a student of class XI and aged about
17 years. On 22.11.2018 at about 11.30 PM, while they were sleeping they saw
that accused Dadu Handique was sitting in the room of victim. On this they

apprehended the accused and raised alarm. Nearby peoples gathered in his

Spl (P) Case No. 02/19 Page 2 of 6
house. Gaonburah Mahananda Chetiya was also called. On asking by
Gaonburah, accused disclosed that he came to his house to take away victim
‘M' with him. Accused is a married person having one child. His daughter victim
'‘M' also stated his willingness to go with the accused. On their arrogance, on
the next day PW 1 filed the FIR vide Exbt. 1 and handed over the accused at
Simaluguri P.S. PW 1 further deposed that police seized Admit Card of the
victim vide Exbt. 2 the seizure list. Exbt. 3 is the seized Admit Card of victim
issued by SEBA (proved-in-original). As per Admit Card, the date of birth of the
victim is 01.09.2002. In their cross by defence, PW 1 and 3 stated that victim
was also adamant to marry the accused. They denied that victim was elder than
18 years of age. PW 1 admitted that he cannot say about the contents of the
FIR. It is also denied by PW 1 that neither police seized the Exbt. 3 (Admit
Card) from him nor handed over back the original to him. PW 1 admitted that
his marriage was performed in the year 1997. He has four children. Victim is his
second child. The first child was born after one year of his marriage. Victim was
born after one year of his first child. Victim might be born in the year 1999. PW
1 and 3 further stated that as their daughter victim 'M' has left her adamency to

marry the accused, they are not willing to proceed further with this case.

8. PW 2 the victim in her evidence deposed _ that
at the relevant time of incident she was a student of class XI and aged about 17
years. Her date of Birth is 01.09.2002. Prior to this incident, she has love affairs
with Dadu Handique for about 2 years. On 22.11.2018, on her call over phone,
at about 11 PM accused came to her house and he entered their house as she
opened the door. At that time, her parents were sleeping. She also cooked rice
for him. He took his dinner in her room. While he was sitting with her in her
room, suddenly her mother came to her room and saw him and called her
father. On getting up, her father closed the door and called other family
members and villagers. Villagers also saw the accused in her room. Gaonburah

was also called. On asking by Gaonburah, both of them disclosed that they love

Spl (P) Case No. 02/19 Page 3 of 6
each other. She knew that accused is a married person having one child. On the
next day, her father filed the FIR and handed over the accused to Simaluguri
PS. She was also taken to Police Station. Police also took her to Hospital for
medical check up and to Court for her statement vide Exbt. 4. Victim further
deposed that, on her refusal to return back to home, she was sent to
Swapnalaya, where she stayed for about 25 days. Thereafter she returned
home and presently staying with her parents. In her cross by defence victim
admitted that she does not have birth certificate. She cannot say the exact date
of birth. The date of Birth as stated by her is as per school Admit Card. Her
brother is one year elder than her. She denied that presently she is aged about

19 years.

9. From the above evidence, so far age is concerned, as per Admit
card, the date f birth of victim was 01.09.2002 and on the date of occurrence
i.e. ON 22.11.2018, the victim was aged about 16 years 9 months. However PW
PW 1 to 3 admitted they cannot say the exact date of birth. PW 2 also admitted
she deposed her date of birth as mentioned in the admit card. PW 1 admitted
that he married in the year 1997 and the victim was born within 2 years of their
marriage. She might be born in 1999. In medical examination report, as per
radiological report, the age was determined as above 18 years. Considering all
above, | am of the considered opinion that on 22.11.2018, the victim was aged

above 18 years.

10. So far the allegation of sexual assault by the accused, from the
evidence on record, it appears that there is no denial to the fact that accused
was present in the room of the victim and he was seen by the parents of the
victim. From the evidence of PW 2 the victim, it appears that prior to this
incident, she has love affairs with the accused for about two years and on the
day of incident, on being called and opening the door by her, accused entered
in her room and except taking food and sitting with her in her room, accused

did nothing with her. In her evidence the victim nowhere stated that accused

Spl (P) Case No. 02/19 Page 4 of 6
has committed sexual assault on her. PW 3 though deposed that she that
accused was holding the hand of the victim but this fact was not supported by
the victim. From the evidence of PW 1 and 3 it also reveals that as the victim
was adamant on her stand to marry the accused, PW 1 lodged the FIR. Both
PW 1 and PW 3 in their cross examination admitted that as the victim left her
adamancy, they are not interested to proceed further with this case. From the
above evidence, it appears that the ingredients of offence u/s 8 of POCSO Act

are totally missing in this case.

11. Considering the above evidence on record, | am of the opinion
that prosecution has failed to prove the ingredients of charge u/s 8 of POCSO
Act against the accused Sri Dadu Handique. As such, accused Sri Dadu
Handique is acquitted from the charge u/s 8 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at
liberty forthwith.

12. Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety are extended

for another six months from today u/s 437-A Cr.P.C.

13. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation u/s
357-A CrP.C.

14. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar u/s 365 CrP.C.

15. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of

on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 3 day of May,
2019 at Sivasagar.
