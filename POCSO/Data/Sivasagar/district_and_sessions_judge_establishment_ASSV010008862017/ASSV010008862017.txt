Spl. (P) Case No. 37/2017 Page 2 of 6
daughter victim 'M' whose date of birth is 29.06.2002, got missing from their
house. Non-finding her, they have searched for the victim but failed to get her
whereabouts. On 24.01.2017 she lodged one FIR at Amguri P.S. Exbt. 1 is the
said FIR. PW 1 further deposed that on 05.05.2017, police recovered the
victim from the house of the accused. On the next day she met the victim in
the Police Station and on asking, victim told her that for last three and half
month, she was with accused at Seleng Bagan area at the house of relative of
the accused. Victim also stated that she cannot say how she went with the
accused. Victim also stated that she had love affairs with the accused for last
six months. In her cross by defence PW 1 stated that her daughter victim 'M'
read upto Class-V in Bagan L.P. School. She has not submitted any document
to show her age either to police or in court. FIR was written by others. She
cannot say about the contents of the FIR. She has not mentioned the reason
for delay in lodging the FIR. She denied that on the date of missing her
daughter, she rebuked her badly and for this she left her residence. Her
daughter works in local small Tea Estate. PW 1 further stated that victim did

not state before her that accused has taken her or kept her forcibly.

9. PW 2, the victim 'M' in her evidence deposed that accused is
known to her being neighbour. She has love affairs with the accused. On
16.01.2017, at about 9 PM she eloped with the accused as she had some
quarrel with her mother. On the same night, they went to the residence of
brother of accused at Seleng Tea Estate. They stayed there for about three
months. After three months of her stay at Seleng, she and accused performed
marriage at Mandir and returned to the residence of accused. PW 2 further
deposed that they made physical relation at the residence of the accused.
After three days of her stay at the residence of accused, police recovered her
and brought to Police Station. Her mother is aware of her stay at the residence
of accused. Presently she is living with her parents. In cross victim admitted
that she went with the accused on her own. She has performed marriage with
the accused. Accused did not force her to stay with him and also did not keep
her confined. While staying at Seleng Tea Estate, she used to move around.
Spl. (P) Case No. 37/2017 Page 3 of 6
She denied that on the date of elopement, her age is above 18 years. She has

Stated her age on assumption.

10. PW 3 Sri Ashok Chowra, father of the victim also deposed in
similar line of PW 1 stating that on 16.01.2017, at about 9 PM, his daughter
victim 'M' got missing from their house. Non-finding her, they have searched
for the victim. After failing to get her whereabouts, on 24.01.2017 his wife
lodged one FIR at Amguri P.S. On 05.05.2017, police recovered the victim
from the residence of accused Akash Tanti. On the next day, he went to P.S.
and met the victim. On asking, victim told him that for last three months, she
was with accused at Seleng Bagan area. Victim also said that she cannot say

how she went with the accused. Presently victim is living with him.

ae From the above evidence on record, particularly from the
evidence of PW 2 the victim, it appears that having love affairs with the
accused, on the day of occurrence, i.e. on 16.01.2017, she had some quarrel
with her mother and out of anger, on that day, at about 9 PM, she eloped with
the accused on her own and stayed at the residence of the brother of accused
at Seleng Tea Estate for about three months and there she performed her
marriage with the accused at Mandir and thereafter both of them returned to
the house of accused. In her cross, PW 2 admitted that she went with the
accused on her own and accused did not force her to stay with him. PW 1 and
PW 3, who are the parents of the victim simply deposed that due to non-
finding the victim in their house on 16.01.2017 and after failing to get her
whereabouts, on 24.02.2017, PW 1 lodged one FIR at Amguri P.S. On
05.05.2017, police recovered the victim and on asking, victim stated that she
cannot say how she went with the accused. So from their evidence, it appears
that none of them deposed anything against the accused involving him with
the alleged offence of kidnap. Their evidence clearly shows that accused did
not kidnap or abduct the victim, rather victim on her own eloped with the

accused and subsequently entered into marriage with the accused.

12. On the next charge regarding commission of penetrative sexual

Spl. (P) Case No. 37/2017 Page 4 of 6
assault, from the evidence of PW 2 the victim, it appears that while giving
Statement in court she has not deposed anything about of sexual relation with
accused. In her evidence the victim nowhere stated that accused has
committed sexual intercourse with her without her consent. Victim admitted
that at the time of elopement, she was aged above 18 years of age. Hence

any such relation with consent cannot be treated as offence.

13. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the charge u/s 366 IPC read with Section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012
against the accused Akash Tanti. As such, accused Akash Tanti is acquitted
from the charge u/s 366 of IPC read with Section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and
Set at liberty forthwith.

14. As the accused is in Jail, no order is passed U/S 437 of Cr.P.C.
for securing release of the accused from Jail.

15. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred
to DLSA for granting compensation U/S 357-A Cr.P.C.

16. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

17. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on
contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 16" day of
November, 2018 Sivasagar.
