give KISS. She also denied that she deposed falsely that accused asked for the

kiss, pulled her to Kalmu Bushes by holding her hand and laid her on ground.

9. PW-3 Sri Dilip Hazarika, in his evidence deposed that on
22.01.2017 at about 3 PM while he was working in his orchard at Kunjan Ali
Path, Sivasagar, he noticed that victim was coming with an unknown boy.
Suddenly he saw that both of them entered in roadside jungle. On this he
scolded the victim. On this they left the place separately. At evening hours, he
informed the matter to mother of the victim. In his cross-examination he

Spl. (P) Case No. 5/2017 Page 3 of 6
from a distance of about 100 meter. He scolded the victim on seeing her while
hiding on his scolding immediately they came out of the jungle and left the
place. Both of them went on opposite direction. He has not seen the boy in

pulling Priyanka to jungle.

10. PW-4 Sri Bakul Bora, I/O of this case, in his evidence deposed
that on taking charge of investigation, he went to the place of occurrence i.e.
Kunjan Path bypass and drawn a sketch map of the PO. Exbt. 4 is the said
Sketch map. On 23.01.2017, victim was sent to Court for recording her
statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. During investigation, he collected the medical report
and statement given by victim in court and seized school certificate of the
victim. Exbt. 2 is the seizure list. As per school certificate the date of birth of
the victim is 26.02.2004. Accused was arrested and forwarded to court. On
completion of investigation, he has submitted charge sheet against the accused
u/s 8 of POCSO Act. Exbt. 5 is the charge sheet. In his cross-examination he
deposed that as per FIR, date of incident was 22.01.2017. FIR was filed on
23.01.2017. In the FIR, there was no mention about the cause of delay in
lodging the FIR. The distance of Police station is about 3 KM from the place of
occurrence. In the sketch map though, he mentioned about existence of local
peoples, but he did not examine any of them. He denied that, case was not
investigated properly and he submitted the charge sheet without proper

material.

11. Point No. |: So far age of the victim is concerned, from the evidence
on record it appears that on the date of incident as stated by P.W. 1, the victim
was aged about 14 years and she was a student of Class-I|X. The victim in her
evidence deposed that her date of birth is 24.02.2004 and at the relevant time
she was a Student of Class-IX. 1/O has deposed that as per school certificate
the date of birth of the victim is 26.02.2004. The above evidence on age of the
victim remains unchallenged. The alleged incident happened on 22.01.2017. As

such, as per record, on the date of incident victim was aged about 13 years.

Spl. (P) Case No. 5/2017 Page 4 of 6
12. Point No. Il: So far allegation of sexual assault on the victim 'P' is
concerned, from the evidence of P.W. 3, admittedly an eye witness of the
incident, it appears that he did not support the evidence of P.W. 2 about pulling
her by the accused by holding her hand, demanding kiss by accused and laying
her on the ground. P.W. 3, has noticed both of them from a close distance and
categorically stated that he has seen the victim coming with an unknown boy
and suddenly both of them entered in roadside jungle. The victim though stated
that her uncle arrived there and saw her in laying condition also did not get any

corroboration from P.W. 3.

13. From the evidence of P.W. 3 it depicts that while both accused
and victim were coming together, suddenly they were seen by the P.W. 3 and
on seeing him both of them entered in roadside jungle and thereafter on his
arrival both of them left the place on opposite direction. Thus the evidence of
victim appears to be exaggerated on material point and did not get any support
so far holding her hand, pulling her to roadside jungle and demanding for kiss
by the accused and laying her on the ground. Thus her evidence appears to
untrustworthy and cannot be relied upon for drawing presumption u/s 29 of
Pocso Act. | found force in the submission of learned Advocate for the defence
that out of their acquaintance, while victim was going on the road by talking
with the accused, she was noticed by her uncle P.W. 3 and out of fear both of
them got themselves hidden in roadside jungle and on being detected, the

other part of the story was concocted to make out a case.

14. Considering the available materials on record, | am of the opinion
that it is fit case where accused should be given the benefit of doubt, simply
because mere going with a minor girl by the side of the road cannot be an
offence under the provision of POCSO Act or any other law. Prosecution has

failed to prove the allegations beyond reasonable doubt.

15. Considering all above, accused Bicky Kr. Jha is acquitted from the
charge U/S 8 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

Spl. (P) Case No. 5/2017 Page 5 of 6
16. Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety are extended for
another six months from today U/S 437-A Cr.P.C.

17. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357-A Cr.P.C.

18. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

19. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case Is disposed of on
contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 12" day of
