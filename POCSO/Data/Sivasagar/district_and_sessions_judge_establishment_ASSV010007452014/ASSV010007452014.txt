7, (i) Whether on 16.07.2014, at about3.00 p.m., accusedPinku
Rahman committed aggravated penetrative sexual assault on the victim

'X' who is below 12 years?
DECI SION AND REASONS THEREOF :

8. P.W.1 the victim 'X' in her evidence deposed that about five
months of the occurrence, accused proposed her to start love affair with her,

but she refused. She further deposed that accused also intended to commit
Spl. (P) Case No.21 of 2014Page 2 of 6
misdeed with her but failed as her sister Pinky arrived there. Thereafter an
altercation took place between them. On this incident, her mother lodged an
FIR. She gave her statement in the court. Exbt.1 is her statement and Exbt.1(1)
and Exbt.1(2) are her signatures. She was also medically examined. In her
cross she deposed that prior to the occurrence, quarrel took place between her

father and accused's father.

9. P.W. 2, the informant Smt. Rumena Begum in her evidence
deposed that about a year back, one day, her elder daughter Pinky told her that
She has seen the accused and victim 'X' together in one room and when she
arrived there, the accused left the place. She further deposed that as per advice
of the villagers, she lodged Ejahar. Accused did not misbehave the victim 'X'
and now she Is not interested to proceed further with this case. In her cross-
examination, she deposed that misunderstanding which took place between
them was settled with the help of villagers. She has also no objection in

acquittal of the accused.

10. P.W.3 Smt. Pinky Begum in her evidence deposed that about a
year back, one day she saw the accused and her younger sister, i.e. victim 'X'
together in one room, and on suspicion that accused might have committed
misdeed with victim 'X', she informed the matter to her mother. Later on her
mother lodged Ejahar. P.W.3 further deposed that she did not see any incident
of doing misdeed by accused with victim 'X'. She also gave her statement in the
court. Exbt.3 is her statement and Exbt.3(1) is her signature. In cross
examination P.W.3 deposed that she has no objection in acquittal of the

accused.

Ti. P.W.4 Sri Prabhakar Singh, the 1.0. of this case in his evidence
deposed that on 18.07.2014 during investigation, he visited the place of
occurrence, recorded the statements of the witnesses and also prepared Sketch

map (Ext.4).Victim was medically examined. He collected the medical report.

Spl. (P) Case No.21 of 2014Page 3 of 6
During investigation he seized a skirt and one yellow colour top of the victim
vide seizure list Ext.5. On completion of investigation, he submitted Charge-
Sheet against the accused U/S 6 of POCSO Act (Ext.6).

12. P.W.5 Dr. Sadhan Bora, in his evidence deposed that on
19.07.2014, on police requisition, he examined the victim 'X' in connection with
Demow P. S. Case No.226/2014 U/S 6 of POCSO Act and upon examination
opined that - (i) her age is above 16 years and below 18 years, (il) no any
recent sign of sexual intercourse, (iii) no any injury detected on her private
parts, & (iv) she is not pregnant at the time of examination. Pw 5 has proved
his report as Ext.4.1n cross examination P.W.5 deposed that the patient gave

her brief history as kidnap.

13. From the above evidence on record, it appears that as per the
evidence of victim 'X', accused proposed to start love affair with her but she
refused and on this accused intended to commit some misdeed with her, but by
that time her elder sister arrived there and an altercation took place. P.W.3
Pinky Begum in her evidence simply stated that she saw the accused and the
victim 'X' in one room and on suspicion that accused might have committed
some misdeed, she informed the matter to her mother. She further admitted
that she has not seen any incident of doing misdeed with the victim 'X'. P.W.2,
the mother of the victim 'X' in her evidence deposed that she heard the matter
from her elder daughter Pinky. She categorically stated that accused did not
misbehave her daughter, and she is no longer interested to proceed with this
case. In cross she furtheradmitted that due to some misunderstanding the case
was filed and she has no objection in acquittal of the accused. It may be
mentioned here that admittedly the accused is the first cousin of the victim 'X’.
Medical Officer (P.W.5) in his evidence stated that the victim 'X' came to him
with a brief history of kidnap. Victim in her cross-examination admitted that

there was some dispute between the two families prior to this incident.

Spl. (P) Case No.21 of 2014Page 4 of 6
14. The evidence as discussed above do not show any sexual assault
either penetrative or even non-penetrative by the accused on the victim.
Admittedly there was some misunderstanding between the parties and the FIR

got lodged.

15. Considering all above, | hold that the ingredients of Section 6 of
POCSO Act, 2012, or any other minor offence are missing. Prosecution has
miserably failed to prove the ingredients of the charge framed against the

accused person.

16. Accordingly, accused Pinku Rahman is acquitted from the charge
U/S 6 of POCSO Act, 2012.

17. Bail bonds executed by the accused and his surety stand extended

for another six months from today.

18. Considering the nature of the case | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357-A Cr.P.C.

19. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

20. Judgment is pronounced in open court. Case is disposed on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 28" day of March,
2017 at Sivasagar.
