POINT FOR DETERMINATION IS_-

6. (i) Whether on 01.01.2017, at midnight hours, accused Haricharan

Ghatowar has committed aggravated sexual assault on his minor children?
DECI SION AND REASONS THEREOF :

7. PW-1 Smt. Mondila Ghatowar, wife of the accused and informant
of this case, in her evidence deposed that on 01.01.2017, at midnight while she
was sleeping with her 5 year old son and 3 year old daughter, her husband,
who was also sleeping with them, touched his penis to children’s private parts
in the name of some ritual. Her husband did so on earlier occasions too. On her
objection, accused assaulted her and she had to flee away to her paternal

home. On knowing this, villagers physically assaulted her husband and handed

Spl. (P) Case No. 3/2017 Page 2 of 5
over him to police. She lodged the FIR at Sonari PS. In her cross-examination,
she admitted that for new year day, after consuming excessive liquor, her
husband was out of control. On that night there was some quarrel with accused
for late coming and taking excessive liquor. On this, she left the matrimonial
home and went to her paternal home which is near to the house of the
accused. She stayed at her paternal home till 16" January. She informed the
incident to her parents but local peoples were informed only on 16™ January.
Her husband was at his residence from 1% to 16". On insistence by Mahila
Samity and VDP, she lodged the FIR. She denied the defence suggestion that
at the instigation of others, she lodged false FIR and that accused did not

commit any misdeed with his children.

8. CW-1 Sri Subham Ghatowar, a Student of Class | and one of the
alleged victim of this case, in his evidence deposed that his father Haricharan
Ghatowar used to assault his mother and also used to open his pant. His father
also behave like a mad man. His father also consumes liquor and some time

assaults me.

9. PW-2 Sri Dipak Bagh, the VDP President of the area in his
evidence deposed that on 16.01.2017, while he was at his house, local public &
Mahila Samity apprehended Haricharan and brought to him after assaulting
him. He rescued him form public and handed over to Sonari PS. It was reported
to him he attempted to molest his minor children. He wrote the FIR under the
dictation of Mandila Ghatowar. Exbt. 1 is the FIR. In his cross-examination he

admitted that members of Mahila Samity have reported the incident to him.

10. From the above evidence on record, it appears that so far the
allegation of sexual assault is concerned, though PW 1 has deposed about
touching of private parts of two minor children by the accused is concerned, but
CW 1, one of the victim, was silent on this aspect. His evidence shows of
assault on her mother only and mad behaviour of the accused after consuming

liquor. Assault on PW 1 under the influence of excessive liquor was not denied

Spl. (P) Case No. 3/2017 Page 3 of 5
by the accused. However, no charge was framed on that aspect. The FIR was
lodged by the victim wife after 16 days of incident of assault which casts a
serious doubt on the genuineness of incident of sexual assault on the particular
day. It is also in the evidence that Fir was lodged at the instigation of Mahila
Samity.

11. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the charge U/S 10 of POCSO Act against the accused Haricharan

Ghatowar. As such, accused Haricharan Ghatowar Is acquitted from the charge
U/S 10 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

12. As the accused is in Jail, no order is passed U/S 437 A Cr.P.C. for

release of the accused from Jail.

13. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357A Cr.P.C.

14. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

15. Learned Legal Aid counsel is entitled for his professional fees from

DLSA Sivasagar as per rules.

16. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 4‘° day of August
2017 at Sivasagar.
