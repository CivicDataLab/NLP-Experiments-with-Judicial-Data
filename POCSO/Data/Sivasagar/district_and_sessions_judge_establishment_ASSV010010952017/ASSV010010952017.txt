1. Prosecution case, in brief, is that on 06.09.2017, informant Sri

Suruj Nayak lodged an FIR with O/C, Sonari P.S. alleging, inter alia, that on
27.08.2017, at about 6.00 PM, while his sister victim 'P' (name withheld) went

anybody, else she will face dire consequences.

have been framed against the above named accused person to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed to stand trial. |t may be noted there that initially
the accused was provided the service of Legal Aid Counsel through Mr. D K
Gohain Advocate but subsequently, the same was withdrawn as accused

appointed his own advocate for his defence.

a During trial, prosecution side has examined only three witnesses
including the informant and the victim. Considering the nature of the evidence,
examination of accused u/s 313 Cr.P.C is dispenses with and | proposed to
dispose the case by using powers u/s 232 Cr.P.C. without calling the accused to

enter into defence.

6. | have heard argument of Id. Special P.P. Mr. Srimanta Gogoi and
Mr. D.K. Gohain, learned Legal Aid Counsel and gone through the evidence on

POINTS FOR DETERMINATION ARE -

7. (1) Whether on 27.08.2017, at about 6.00 P.M. accused committed

penetrative sexual assault on the victim 'P'?
DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

8. PW-1 Sri Suruj Nayak informant of this case and brother of the
victim in his evidence deposed that present age of the victim P is about 19
years. On the day of filling the FIR his sister victim P reported him that about a

week back while she went to market, accused Munu Bhumiz has teased her by

Spl. (P) Case No. 44 of 2017 Page 2 of 5
saying SANGO (sister-in-law). On Knowing this, out of anger, he lodged the FIR
at Sonari PS. Exbt. 1 is the FIR. In his cross-examination PW 1 admitted that he
cannot say about the contents of the FIR. Due to some misunderstanding, he

have lodged the FIR. He has no objection in acquittal of the accused.

9. PW-2 the victim P in her evidence deposed that her present age is
about 19 years. About a week of the filling the FIR, while she went to market,
accused Munu Bhumiz has teased her by saying SANGO (sister-in-law) and
many other words. After about a week, on return of her brother from Moran,
She informed the matter to him. On knowing this, out of anger, he lodged the
FIR at Sonari PS. Police came to investigate the matter and interrogated me.
Police took her for medical examination and also to Court. In her cross-
examination PW 2 admitted that except teasing, accused did nothing with her.
She denied the defence suggestion that accused did not tease her as alleged.
Presently they have compromised the matter in village. Sh ehas no objection in

acquittal of the accused.

10. PW-3 Smt. Radha Sabar cousin-in-law of the victim in her
evidence deposed that she has no knowledge about any incident between the

accused and the victim Priti.

11. From the above evidence on record, it appears that victim is aged

about 19 years. Defence did not challenge this fact.

12. So far charge of sexual assault is concerned, from the evidence of
PW 1 and PW 2 it appears that none of them deposed anything against the
accused implicating him with the alleged offence sexual assault. From their
evidence it appears accused has teased the victim by saying SANGO (sister-in-
law) and many other words. After about a week of the incident, FIR was
lodged. P.W. 2 admitted that except teasing, accused did nothing with her. PW
1 admitted that due to some misunderstanding he has lodged the FIR. Both

P.W. 1 and 2 in their cross examination clearly stated that presently they have

Spl. (P) Case No. 44 of 2017 Page 3 of 5
no objection in acquittal of the accused. P.W.3 deposed nothing regarding the
incident between the accused and the victim 'P’. Thus it is clear that there was
no material whatsoever regarding penetrative sexual assault (rape) by the

accused.

13. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the ingredients of charge U/S 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 against the
accused As such, accused Sri Munu Bhumij is acquitted from the charges U/S
4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

14. Issue release order to the Jail Supdt. of District Jail, Sivasagar
forthwith.

15. As the accused Is in Jail, no order is passed U/S 437 A Cr.P.C.

16. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is

not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357-A Cr.P.C.

17. Learned legal aid counsel is entitled for his professional fees from
DLSA as per rules.

18. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Charaideo U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

19. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case Is disposed of

on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 23 day of
February 2018 Sivasagar.
