DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF :

Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 2 of 12
7. PW-1 Smt. Tileswari Ghatowar, mother of the victim in her
evidence deposed that (deposing on 27.05.219) presently victim T is aged
about 18 years. She is reading in class |X of Santak High School. Victim T was
born in the year 2001. On 09.01.2019, due to non-return of her daughter victim
T from her school till evening hours she searched her. On the next day, she
lodged the FIR. During search, she came to know that victim T was taken to
Palengi and was kept in the house of sister of accused. He went to Palengi and
saw her daughter in the residence of sister of accused Suraj Ghatowar and met
her daughter. As she refused to return with her, she informed the matter to
Bihubar PS. Subsequently police apprehended the accused and recovered victim
T from Palengi area under Demow PS. Police took victim T for medical
examination and also brought her to Court. From Court victim T was given in
her custody. On asking victim T, she informed her that accused committed
misdeed with her for three days at Palengi. She did not state as to how she
reached Palengi. In her cross-examination by defence, she admitted that she
lodged the FIR after three days of the incident of missing. She cannot say
about the contents of the FIR. She denied the defence suggestion that while
giving statement to police, she has not stated that “During search, she came to
know that victim T was taken to Palengi and was kept in the house of sister of
accused; that she went to Palengi and saw that her daughter was at the
residence of sister of accused Suraj Ghatowar and meet her daughter.” She
denied that she deposed falsely on this aspect. Victim T is her eldest daughter.
she was married at the age of 20 years. Victim T was born after 2 years of her
marriage. She denied that victim T was aged more that 18 years at the time of
alleged incident of this case. She shown the birth certificate of victim T to
police, but police did not take the same. She had no knowledge if her daughter
has love affairs with the accused for about 2 years and for said relation, her
daughter took the accused with her. She do not want to prosecute this case
further. She has no objection in acquittal of the accused from this case.

8. PW-2 the victim T in her evidence deposed that accused Suraj
Ghatowar is known to her through mobile phone. She is aged about 17 years

Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 3 of 12
and reading in class |X at Santak High School. Her date of birth is 01.07.2001.
On 09.01.2019, at morning hours she came out of her house for going to
school but without going to school, she came to Simaluguri Tiniali as requested
by the accused over phone. At about 12 noon, Suraj Ghatowar came there and
met her. From Simaluguri they came to Disang Rajabari in public vehicle on her
own desire and went to the house of sister of accused. They stayed there for
about 8 days. She slept with the accused on 3 nights. He did not use force on
her. However they have physical on her consent. Though her mother came to
that house, yet she refused to go back to home with her. Subsequently, police
came there and apprehended the accused and bring her to Bihubar PS. Police
took her for medical check up and also in Court. She gave her statement in
Court. Exbt. 1 is her statement in Court. On that day, she deposed on similar
lines as deposed today. From Court, she went with her mother and informed
that she slept with the accused on 3 occasions. In her cross-examination by
defence, she admitted that while giving statement in Nazira Court, she stated
that she eloped with Suresh wilfully on 08.01.2019 and that she returned with
her mother. She denied that police did not recover her from the house of sister
of accused. She also denied that at the time of incident, she was aged above 18
years. She did not bring her birth certificate which is at her residence. Same
was not given to police. She has not stated before the medical officer that
accused made physical relation with her on 3 occasions. She had love affairs
with the accused for about 1 month. As she failed in class IX exams, out of
fear, she eloped with the accused. She denied that, she deposed falsely about
making physical relation with the accused while staying with the accused.

9. PW - 3 Sri Ramesh Ghatowar, maternal uncle of the victim T in is
evidence deposed that victim T is reading in class |X of Santak High School. She
was born in the year 2001. He proved the age certificate issued by Santak T E
Hospital. As per this certificate date of birth of victim is 02.07.2001. Exbt. 2
(proved-in-original) is the age certificate. After three days of the incident of
non-return of victim T from her school till evening hours, he came to know that
victim T was taken by the accused to Palengi. On knowing this, after 8 days, his

Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 4 of 12
sister Tileswari went to Palengi to bring back victim T Ghatowar but she refused
to return with her. On this Tileswari informed the matter to Bihubar PS.
Subsequently Bihubar police recovered victim T from Palengi area under
Demow PS. He did not ask her about the incident. In his cross-examination by
defence, he denied that while giving statement to police, he has not stated
regarding taking of victim T by the accused to his sister’s house and her
recovery by police. He brought the Exbt. 2 certificate on being handed over to
him by Tileswari Ghatowar. In the school certificate shown to me from the case
record, the date of Birth of victim T was mentioned as 25.07.2001. Exbt. A is
the age proof certificate issued by Santak High School. He denied that Exbt. 2 is
not the age certificate of victim T. Apparently, in Exbt. 2, there is over writings
on the name of the father of the victim. He further denied that he deposed
falsely on the age of the victim.

10. PW - 4 Sri Kajal Bawri in his evidence deposed that on the same
night of the incident, when he went to the house of his cousin Tileswar
Ghatowar, he came to know that victim T did not return from her school till
evening hours. They searched for her. After 8 days, Bihubar police recovered
victim T from Palengi area from the custody of the accused. He also came to
know that on these 8 days victim T stayed with the accused Suraj. He did not
ask her about the incident. In his cross-examination by defence, PW 4 denied
that before police he has stated as deposed in court.

11. PW - 5 Smt. Satni Ghatowar in her evidence deposed that on the
date of incident, due to fail in exams, mother of victim T scolded her daughter.
On this victim T left her house and as she did not return till evening hours, they
searched for her. Subsequently on being rang by accused, they came to know
that victim T was Disang Rajabari. Matter was informed to police. After 8 days,
Bihubar police recovered victim T from Disang Rajabari area from the custody
of the accused. Victim T told me that she on her own went with the accused. In
her cross-examination she denied that while giving statement to police, she has
not stated that on being rang by accused, they came to know that victim T was
Disang Rajabari.”

Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 5 of 12
12. PW 6 Sri Chandreswar Rajput in his evidence deposed that he
heard that victim T eloped from her house and after about 8 days, she was
brought back to her house by police. Except this, | have no knowledge of this
case.

13. PW 7 Dr. Sundar Changmai, the medical officer, in his evidence
deposed that on 18.01.2019, at 01.30 PM, on police requisition, he examined
victim T in connection with Bihubor P.S. Case No. 01/19 and upon examination,
he found her hymen- Absent. As per radiological examination (done on
18.01.2019), her age is between 17-18 years. Ext. 3 is the Medical report and
Ext. 3(1) is his signature and Ext. 3(2) is the radiological examination report. In
his cross-examination he admitted that as per report of radiologist, the age of
the victim is above 18 years as there is completely developed elbow joint.

14. PW 8 SI (P) Banikanta Pegu in his evidence deposed that on
10.01.2019, the then O/C Bihubar PS has received one written FIR from Smt.
Tileswari Gahtowar and registered Bihubar PS case No. 1/19 u/s 366 IPC and
entrusted me to investigate the case. Exbt. 4 is the FIR. During investigation,
he went to residence of informant at Santak Bagan Line No. 3 and drawn a
Sketch map of the PO. Exbt. 5 is the said sketch map. During investigation, |
came to know that one Suraj Ghatowar has kidnapped the victim T and
collecting phone number of the accused, through his source, he came to know
that accused has kept the victim at Rajabari Palengi under Demow PS. After
informing the matter to O/C Demow PS, on 17.01.2019, he went to Palengi and
recovered to the victim from the possession of accused while they were moving
on road. He took them to Demow PS and then brought them to Bihubar PS.
Accused was apprehended. On the next day, i.e. on 18.01.2019, victim T was
sent for medical examination and also sent to Nazira Court for recording her
Statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. During investigation, he collected the medical report
and statement given by victim in court. During investigation, he collected one
school certificate showing age of the victim from Santak High School. Exbt. A is
the school certificate issued by Santak High School in which date of birth of
victim T is mentioned as 25.07.2001. On completion of investigation, he

Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 6 of 12
submitted charge sheet against the accused u/s 366 IPC and section 4 of
POCSO Act. Exbt. 6 is the charge sheet. In his cross-examination by defence,
he admitted that he has not collected any G D Entry from Demow PS showing
his visit to said PS. He denied that he did not recover victim with the assistance
of Demow PS and hence failed to prove any G D Entry. He recovered the victim
from Road at Palengi with the accused. There is no mention in the CD
regarding collection Exbt. A from Santak High School. He has not recorded
statement of school authority in respect of the school certificate. He denied that
he procured one false certificate of age of the victim and without observing
legal formalities attached with CD. He confirmed the exaggerations made by
witnesses in their evidence from their previous statements.

15. From the above evidence on record, let me decide the points

formulated for just decision of this case.

16. Point No. I: So far age of the victim is concerned, from the
evidence of PW 1, mother of the victim by deposing on 27.05.19 stated that her
daughter victim 'T' is aged about 18 years and she is reading in class |X of
Santak High School and she was born in the year 2001. In her cross she denied
that at the time of alleged incident her daughter victim ‘T’ was more than 18
years of age. The victim ‘T’ in her evidence (deposing on 27.05.19) claimed her
age as 17 years and a student of class |X at Santak High School and stated her
date of birth is 01.07.2001. She also denied that she is aged above 18 year of
age. PW 3, the maternal uncle of the victim proved one certificate (Exbt. 1)
issued by Santak Tea Estate Hospital in which the date of birth of the victim
was mentioned as 02.07.2001. In his cross he admitted that said certificate was
handed over to him by the mother of the victim. He admitted that in the school
certificate (Exbt. 2) shown to him from the case record, the date of birth of the
victim was mentioned as 25.07.2001. PW 3 further admitted that in Exbt. 2,
there was over writing on the name of the father of the victim. PW 7 Dr.
Sundar Changmai, the M.O. in his evidence deposed that on 18.01.2019, he
examined the victim and as per the radiological report he determined the age of

the victim between 17 to 18 years. However in his cross-examination he
Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 7 of 12
admitted that as per report of radiologist, the age of the victim is above 18
years as there is completely developed elbow joint. PW 8 SI (P) Banikanta
Pegu, the |.O. of this case in his evidence deposed that during investigation he
has collected one certificate issued by Santak High School in which date of birth
of the victim was mentioned as 25.07.2001. But in his cross-examination he

admitted that he has not examined school authority in respect of age.

17. From the above evidence on age, it appears that there are two
certificates on record on the date of birth of the victim, i.e. 02.07.2001 as per
hospital record (Exbt. 1) and 25.07.2001 as per Santak High School (Exbt. 2).
Birth certificate was not brought on record though same was available. The
M/O in his cross-examination admitted that as per report of radiologist, the age
of the victim is above 18 years as there is completely developed elbow joint.
Thus there are three views on the age of the victim T. When the above aspect
on age of the victim was put to the accused in his 313 Cr.P.C. examination, he
simply stated his ignorance on age and he did not take any other plea on the
age of the victim. During cross-examination the defence suggested that the
victim was above 18 years of age. Under above facts and circumstances, on
close look, it appears that as the 2 certificates give different dates, none of
them should be relied upon for determining the age of the victim. On this, the
medical evidence is found more reliable. Considering x-ray reports of complete
fusion of elbow joint, | hold that on the alleged date of incident the victim was

above 18 years of age.

18. Point No. II: From the evidence of the PW 2 the victim, it appears
that on 09.01.2019, at morning hours, after coming out from her house for
going to school she came to Simaluguri Tiniali as requested by the accused over
phone and therefrom she went to Desang Rajabari with the accused in a public
vehicle on her own will and stayed at the residence of the sister of the accused
for about eight days. The victim further deposed that while giving to the
custody of her mother after her recovery, she informed her mother that she

Slept with the accused on three occasions. PW 1, mother of the victim in her

Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 8 of 12
evidence stated that on knowing the fact that her daughter victim ‘T’ was kept
at Palengi in the house of the sister of the accused, she went there and met her
daughter but her daughter refused to return with her. Subsequently with the
help of police she has to recover the victim. This part of evidence was
supported by PW 3. PW 4 and PW 5 have supported the fact of recovery of the
victim by Bihubor PS from Desang Rajabari area. PW 8 the 1.0. in his evidence
has corroborated this fact that on 17.01.2019 he went to Palengi and recovered
the victim from the possession of the accused. This fact was admitted by the
accused in his 313 Cr.P.C. statement. As such, it is clear that on the date of
incident victim went with the accused and after staying with him for about eight
days at the residence of the sister of the accused, victim was recovered along
with the accused from Palengi area.

19. Now the question arose for determination is whether
accompanying a major girl who left her house and stayed without consent of
the guardian can be treated as an offence of abduction as defined u/s 362 IPC.
In this case, as discussed earlier, there is clear evidence that the victim on her
own went with the accused. She did not allege of any inducement or use of
force on her. In the instant case, ingredients of offence u/s 366 IPC or even
any other minor offence like section 366-A, 363 IPC are totally missing. As
such, | am of the considered opinion that no case is made out so far the
offence u/s 363, 366, 366-A IPC is concerned.

20. Point No. III: So far the charge of penetrative sexual
assault/rape on the victim is concerned, from the evidence of PW 2 it appears
that she slept with the accused for three night during her stay of eight days at
the residence of the sister of the accused at Palengi. Victim further deposed
that they have established physical relation on her consent. In her cross the
victim admitted that before M.O. she did not state that accused made physical
relation with her on three occasions, she has love affairs with the accused for
one month. Victim denied that she deposed falsely regarding physical relation
by the accused. PW 1, mother of the victim in her evidence deposed that after
recovery of the victim she was brought to Court and from Court the victim was

Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 9 of 12
given to her custody. On asking, the victim informed her that accused
committed misdeed with her for three days at Palengi. On looking at the
medical evidence which was done on 18.01.2019, i.e. after nine days of her
elopement, it appears that hymen of the victim was found absent but no injury
was found on her private parts. M.O. also did not find any evidence of recent
sexual intercourse. The other witnesses are totally silent regarding physical
relation between the accused and the victim. Accused in his 313 Cr.P.C.
statement however denied the allegation of having physical relation with the
victim as stated by PW 1 and PW 2 and claimed his innocence by stating that
he did not commit any physical relation with the victim. On looking at the
Statement of the victim given u/s 164 Cr.P.C., it appears that soon after her
recovery she has stated that she stayed with the accused for eight days and
without solemnizing marriage she had sexual intercourse on five occasions
during her stay with the accused on her consent. She specifically admitted that
accused did not use any force. Considering the above materials, and the fact
that the victim is aged above 18 years, the physical relation with consent
cannot be treated as offence under Pocso Act or under section 376 IPC.

21. In view of the above discussions, | hold that prosecution has
failed to prove the ingredients of the offence punishable u/s 366, 376(2) IPC
and section 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 or any other minor offence against the
accused Suraj @ Suresh Ghatowar.

22. Considering all above, accused Suraj @ Suresh Ghatowar is
acquitted from the charge u/s 366, 376(2) IPC and section 6 of POCSO Act,
2012.

23. In view of the provisions of section 437A Cr.P.C and considering
the fact that accused faced the trial as UTP with the help of legal aid counsel,
and also by following the case law of Abdul Malek @ Malek Ali -vs- State of
Assam 2018 (5) GLT 272, | am of the considered opinion that it will be just
and proper to direct that accused Suraj @ Suresh Ghatowar be released
forthwith from Jail custody on execution of P.R bond of Rs. 2,000/- with a
validity of 6 months with a condition that he shall appear before the appellate

Spl. (P) Case No. 13 of 2019 Page 10 of 12
court, if so required.

24. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357(A) Cr.P.C.

25. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

26. Judgment is pronounced in open court. Case is disposed on
contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 21° day of
October, 2019 at Sivasagar.
