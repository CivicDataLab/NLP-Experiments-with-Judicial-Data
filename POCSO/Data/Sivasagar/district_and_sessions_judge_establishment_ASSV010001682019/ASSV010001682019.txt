7. PW 1 Sri Bablu Saora, the informant and elder brother of the

Spl (P) Case No. 10/19 Page 2 of 6
victim, in his evidence deposed that Victim 'M' read up to class IX and left her
Studies. His present age is 20 years. His sister victim 'M' is 2 years younger than
him. On 12.02.2019, at evening hours, on returning home from Arunachal
Pradesh, he came to know that his sister victim 'M' is at the residence of
accused Uttam. On knowing this, he went to the house of accused and saw her
sitting in that house. On his asking, victim stated him that she was called by
accused Uttam to his house on the previous day and she stayed in his house for
one night. On this there was a quarrel between him and the accused and they
both assaulted each other. At that time accused was married having two child.
His wife died few days back of this incident. After making quarrel with the
accused, he brought back the victim. PW 1 further deposed that on this
incident, he has called one village meeting and as asked by the meeting, he
filed the FIR. On his asking, his sister victim 'M' told him that while staying at
the residence of accused, he did not misbehave her or did not commit any
misdeed with her. In his cross he stated that he has no knowledge if his sister
victim 'M' has love affairs with the accused. He admitted that his sister victim

'M' on her own went to the house of accused.

8. PW 2 the victim in her evidence deposed that accused presently
she is aged about 15 years. She read up-to class VIII and left the school in the
year 2018. Her date of birth is 05.09.2003. Exbt. 1 is the school certificate
showing her date of birth (proved-in-original). It is deposed by PW 2 that on
11.02.2019, at about 9 PM, without informing her family members, she went
with accused Uttam Saora to his house and stayed in his house for the night.
On the next day morning her brother Bablu Saora and her aunt Sumitra Mirdha
came to his house and brought her back to her house. A village meeting was
also held. After few days, her brother filed this case. Police took her for medical
checkup and also in Court. She gave her statement in Court vide Exbt. 2. From
Court, she went with her mother and brother and informed them the fact of this
case. In her cross-examination, victim admitted that she went with the accused

on her own for watching TV in his house. Accused did not commit any physical

Spl (P) Case No. 10/19 Page 3 of 6
relation with her. While giving statement in court, she deposed as tutored by
her mother. Accused Uttam did not use force on her for going with him. She has
no objection for acquittal of the accused from this case. Accused is her brother
in law in relation.

9. PW 3 Smt. L. Saora, mother of the victim in her evidence deposed
that victim is presently aged about 16 years. On 11.02.2019, at evening hours,
her daughter victim 'M' went to the house of accused for watching TV and did
not return in the night. On the next day, her son and her sister went to the
house of accused and bring her daughter back. At that time, accused was
married having two children. His wife died few days back of this incident. A
village meeting was also called and as asked by the meeting, her son filed the
case. She further deposed that on her asking, her daughter victim 'M' told her
that while staying at the residence of accused, accused did not misbehaved her.
In her cross examination, she stated that her daughter victim 'M' might be aged
about 18 years. She admitted that her daughter victim 'M' on her own went to
the house of accused. She has no objection for acquittal of the accused from
this case.

10. Basing on the above evidence, so far age of the victim Is
concerned, from the evidence of PW 2, the victim, it appears that she claimed
her present age as 15 years. Victim stated her date of birth as 05.09.2003 and
produced one school certificate (Exbt. 1) showing her date of birth (proved-in-
Original). However the medical examination report of the victim which is
attached with charge sheet, disclosed that on the date of examination, the
victim was above the age of 18 years. Mother of the victim admitted at the time
of incident, victim might be aged about 18 years. Informant also claimed that
victim might be aged about 18 years. Thus having contradictory materials on
record, | would like to rely on the age as determined by medica examination
which get support from the mother of the victim. As such, | hold that on the
alleged date of incident, victim was above the age of 18 years.

11. So far allegation of abduction is concerned, the victim deposed

nothing against the accused involving him with the alleged offence of

Spl (P) Case No. 10/19 Page 4 of 6
abduction. In her evidence the victim nowhere stated that accused by using
force or by inducing took her with him. Her evidence shows that accused being
a relative, without informing her family members, she went with the accused on
her own for watching TV and stayed in the house of accused for the night. This
fact was corroborated by PW 1 and 3. Thus it is clear that there is no
incriminating material against the accused so far allegation of abduction is
concerned. Merely taking the victim to his house and allowing her to stay in his
house cannot be an offence. In the instant case, ingredients of offence u/s 366

IPC or even any other minor offence like section 363 are totally missing.

12. So far charge of rape/penetrative sexual assault is concerned,
from the evidence PW 2 the victim, it appears that she has categorically denied
regarding commission of rape/penetrative sexual assault by the accused while
keeping her with him in his house. In her evidence the victim nowhere stated
that accused has even committed sexual assault on her. There was no material
in the evidence of PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3 regarding rape/aggravated penetrative
sexual assault by the accused. The allegation brought against the accused was
not supported by the victim herself. She further admitted that she gave her
Statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C on being tutored by her mother. It may be noted here
that FIR was lodged after 8 days of the alleged incident, which creates a doubt

on genuineness of the incident.

13. Considering the above evidence on record, | am of the opinion
that prosecution has failed to prove the ingredients of charges u/s 366/376(3)
IPC and Section 4 of POCSO Act 2012 against the accused Sri Uttam Saora. As
such, accused Sri Uttam Saora is acquitted from the charges u/s 366/376(3)
IPC and Section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith. Issue release
order accordingly.

14. No order is passed u/s 437-A CrP.C. as accused is in J ail custody.
15. Considering the facts of the case, the matter is not referred to

DLSA for granting compensation u/s 357-A CrP.C.

Spl (P) Case No. 10/19 Page 5 of 6

17. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on
contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 29" day of May,
