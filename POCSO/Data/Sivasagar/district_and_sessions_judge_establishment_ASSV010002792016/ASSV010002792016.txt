court for recording her statement U/S 164 Cr.P.C. On completion of
investigation, I/O has submitted Charge-Sheet against the accused U/S 4/6
of POCSO Act, 2012.
3. During investigation, vide order dated 19.05.2016, the accused
was allowed to go on bail. On submission of Charge sheet, provision of
section 207 Cr. P.C was complied with and after hearing both the sides,
charge u/s 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 was framed to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed to be tried.
4. During trial, prosecution side has examined only three
witnesses i.e. Medical Officer Dr. Sanjib Mahanta as P.W.1, informant as
PW 2 and victim X as P.W.3.
en Upon completion of the prosecution evidence, accused is
examined U/S 313 Cr.P.C. Defence case is of total denial and false
implication. Accused declined to adduce evidence when he was called upon
to enter into defence.
6. I have heard argument of learned P.P. Mr. A.K. Bora and
learned defence counsel, gone through the evidence and documents and
considered the submission of both the sides.

POINT FOR DETERMINATION IS:-_ -
7s (i) Whether on 28.03.2016, at about 5.00 p.m., the

accused committed aggravated penetrative sexual assault on the

victim X (name witheld) who is below 12 years?

DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF :
8. P.W. 1 is Dr. Sanjib Mahanta in his evidence deposed that on

29.03.2016 at about 11.35 a.m., on police requisition, he examined the

Spl. (P) Case No. 7 of 2016 Page 2 of 5
victim X and on examination of he is of the opinion that the victim girl was
below 16 years of age at the time of examination. There was no evidence
of injury or sing of recent sexual intercourse detected during examination.
He proved his report as Ext.1. In cross examination P.W.1 deposed that he
did not find any injury on her private parts. He denied defence suggestion
that age of the victim might be above 18 years.

9. P.W. 2 Smti Bhanu Begum in her evidence deposed that
accused Robibul Ali is her step son from her husband and victim X is her
daughter. On 28.03.2016, while she was preparing food, at 5 p.m. her
daughter victim X (aged about 6 years) told her that accused Robibul has
physically assaulted her by causing bleeding injury. On this, she informed
the matter to Police Station by lodging an FIR at Cherekapar Out Post. At
that time, her husband was absent. In cross examination by defence, she
admitted that she has not seen the incident on her own. She does not want
to continue the case by adducing further evidence as accused is her step
son. She further deposed that she has no objection if accused is acquitted.
10. P.W. 3 the victim in her evidence deposed that about 6/7
months back her step brother Robibul slapped her on her cheek without any
fault of her. Accused also badly pinched on her hand wherefrom blood come
out. She informed the matter to her mother, who took her to police and
informed the matter. Police also took her to Doctor and also brought her to
court. In cross-examination by defence, she stated that except slapping and
pinching, accused did nothing. Presently they are living with accused by
maintaining good relation.

11. From the above evidence of the victim and her mother, it
appears that there is no evidence of any penetrative sexual assault on the
victim by the accused. Exbt. 1 medical report also shows that there was no
Sign of any injury on private parts. Though some allegation of slapping and
pinching with bleeding was made but the medical officer did not find any

injury as alleged on the person of the victim. Admittedly the victim and the

Spl. (P) Case No. 7 of 2016 Page 3 of 5
accused are related and reside in same campus. Except slapping and
pinching, no other allegation was brought on record. The above act at the
best may lead to offence u/s 323 IPC which is compoundable. In her
evidence, the informant and mother of the victim has submitted that she is
not interested to proceed with the case any more.

12. In view of the above, I hold that prosecution has failed to
prove the ingredients of the offence punishable u/s 6 of POCSO Act, 2012

against the accused.

13. Considering all above, accused Robibul Ali is acquitted from
the charge U/S 6 of POCSO Act, 2012.
14. The bail bonds executed by the accused and his surety stand

extended for another six months from today.

15. Considering the nature of the case I am of the opinion that it
is not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation
U/S 357(A) Cr.P.C.

16. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

17. Judgment is pronounced in open court. Case is disposed on
contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 14 day
of February, 2017 at Sivasagar.
