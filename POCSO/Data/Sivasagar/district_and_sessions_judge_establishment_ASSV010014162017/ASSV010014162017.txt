POINT FOR DETERMINATIONIS— -

7, Whether on 05.09.2017, accused committed aggravated sexual assault

on the victim 'F'?
DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

8. P.W. 1 Sri Prakash Bhuyan, the informant and elder brother of
the victim in his evidence deposed that on 05.09.2017, while he returned home,
his sister victim 'F', who is a student of Class-IX at Borahi M.E. School and
presently aged about 15 years told him that her teacher Kedar Nath Sah make
joke with her at school and she dislikes said teacher. On this, out of anger, he
lodged the FIR at Sonari P.S vide Exbt. 1. In his cross-examination, he admitted
that he has no personal knowledge about the incident except as reported by
the victim. He stated that he has filed this case after three days of the aleged
incident i.e. on 08.09.2017. P.W.1 admitted that that victim 'F' did not complain

him for any misbehave with her by the accused.

9. P.W. 2, the victim ‘F’ in her evidence while stating that her

Spl. (P) Case No. 60/2017 Page 2 of 4
present age is about 15 years, deposed that accused is known to her being
Hindi teacher of Borahi M.E. School. Last year she was a student of Class-VII|
at Borahi M.E. School. On 05.09.2017, on the teachers’ day of celebrations,
after returning home, she informed her brother (P.W.1) that she dislikes her
teacher Kedar Nath Sah. On this, without asking her, her brother lodged the
FIR at Sonari P.S. Subsequently ATSA people took her to Police Station. She got
medically examined and gave her statement in court vide Exbt. 2. In her cross
she admitted that accused did not misbehave her in school and she has given

her statement in court on being tutored by ATSA boys.

10. P.W. 3 Smt. Sunita Bhuyan in her evidence deposed that after
filing of the case, her husband told her that he has filed a case against Kedar
Nath Sah but she did not ask her husband as to why he filed the case.

Ti. From the evidence of P.W.1, P.W. 2 and P.W.3 it is seen that
none of them deposed anything against the accused implicating him with the
alleged offence of sexual assault. From the evidence of P.W. 1 it appears that
out of anger he lodged the FIR against the accused. P.W. 1 and PW 2 clearly
Stated that accused did not misbehave the victim in any manner. P.W. 2
informed her brother (P.W.1) that she dislikes her teacher Kedar Nath Sah. On
this, without asking PW 1 lodged the FIR at Sonari P.S. Though in Exbt. 2
Statement the victim implicated the accused with some allegations of sexual
assault, but in her cross victim has categorically admitted that she has given
her statement in court on being tutored by ATSA boys. P.W. 2 the victim is
totally silent regarding any incident of sexual assault or even of sexual

harassment by the accused in her evidence in courtbnn.

12. Considering above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has failed
to prove the ingredients of offence U/S 10 of POCSO Act or any other minor
offences against the accused Kedar Nath Sah. As such, accused Sri Kedar Nath
Sah is acquitted from the charges U/S 10 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty
forthwith.
