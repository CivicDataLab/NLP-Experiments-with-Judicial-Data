No evidence of recent sexual intercourse detected. There is a radish mark over
mid line of anterior aspect of neck of size 1 cm x lcm. There may be attempt
for sexual intercourse. Ext. 1 is the medical report. In his cross-examination he
admitted that he mentioned about attempt for sexual intercourse basing on the

version of the victim.

14. PW-8 Smt Anjumani Gogi, in her evidence deposed that about 2
years back, she heard that accused has committed misdeed with victim S. She
did not inquire from the victim. In her cross-examination she stated that she
heard the incident while gossiping by local people. There was a village meeting

and in the meeting, the village elders found that the allegation as false.

Spl. (P) Case No. 17/2014 Page 4 of 10
knowledge about the incident in the FIR. Police called him to PS and requested

16. PW-10 Sri Rajib Das in his evidence deposed that on 25.03.2014,
while he was posted as O/C Kakotibari PS, in the newspaper namely NIYOMIYA
BARTA issue dated 23.03.2014, one news item was published at page 5
regarding committing rape by one 60 year old man upon a 10 years old minor
girl at Banamali Disangopub Gaon under Kakotibari PS. As no FIR was received
for the above incident as reported, he made a G D Entry vide Kakotibari PS G D
Entry No. 445 dated 25.03.2014. Exbt. 3 is the certified copy of Kakotibari PS G
D Entry No. 445 dated 25.03.2014. After making the G D Entry, at about 9.35
AM he went to the residence of the victim at village Disangpub Gaon as
mentioned in the news item and recorded her and her parents’ statement. He
also visited the place of occurrence (PO) as shown by the victim. The PO is
bamboo garden on the back side of the house of the victim. Exbt. 4 is the
Sketch map. Exbt. 4 is my signature. Exbt. 5 is another sketch map where the
victim got regularly molested. On the same day i.e. 25.03.2014, Chandua Mura
lodged formal FIR. On this FIR Kakotibari PS case No. 20/14 was registered u/s
376 IPC r/w section 4 of POCSO Act and took charge to investigate the case.
On taking charge of investigation, on the same day victim was sent for medical
examination. On 26.03.2014 victim was sent to Court for recording her
Statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. During investigation he collected the medical report
and statement given by victim in court. Exbt. 6 is the statement of the victim
given u/s 164 Cr.P.C. Accused Miton Sabar @ Ravan has surrendered before
SDJ M(M) Charaideo at Sonari on 20.05.2014 wherefrom accused was remanded
to judicial custody. On completion of investigation, he submitted charge sheet
against the accused u/s 376 r/w section 4 of POCSO Act. Exbt. 7 is the charge
Sheet. In his cross-examination, the 1/O has admitted that the news papers
dated 23.03.2014 on which the alleged news item was published was not made
part of the CD or FIR or the G D Entry. He has not inquired about the news

reporter and did not interrogate the reporter or the editor of the news paper.

Spl. (P) Case No. 17/2014 Page 5 of 10
He made the G D Entry on 25.03.2014 only after knowing about the publication
of the news. There are some apparent over writings on the date of occurrences
in the FIR. During investigation, it revealed that the victim was a student of
class |V. He has not collected any age certificate from the school. As per Exbt.
5, place of occurrence was orchard of Bubul Gogoi. He examined said Bubul
Gogol as witness. During investigation, he has not recorded the statement of

the accused as he surrendered in court. Accused was an aged person.

17. Point No. 1: So far age of the victim is concerned, the victim while
adducing evidence as P.W.1 has claimed her age as 10 years. P.W. 2, the father
of the victim also stated that at the time of alleged incident his daughter was
aged about 10 years. The Medical Officer (P.W.7) however stated that the age
of the victim is above 15 years. No challenge was made on the age of the
victim by the defence either through P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 or through P.W. 7. As
the evidence of M.O. (P.W. 7) being an opinion only and as the father of the
victim is the best person to say the age of his daughter, | am of the opinion
that the evidence given by P.W. 2 regarding age of the victim i.e. victim is aged
about 10 years at the time of alleged incident is found more acceptable and as
such, | hold the age of the victim as about 10 years at the time of alleged

incident.

18. Point No. II: So far allegation of rape is concerned, from the
evidence of victim it appears that in absence of her parents, accused called her
to the bamboo orchard and after opening her clothes committed misdeeds.
Accused also opened her clothes. On attempting to make hue and cry, accused
gagged her mouth. Accused penetrated his penis to her vagina and she got
pain. Thereafter she rushed to the house of Golapi Mura and Sunita Garh and
informed them about the incident. Thereafter victim also informed the incident
to her step-mother. Police got her medically examined. She also got pain on her
neck due to laying her on the ground. In her cross examination, she admitted
that on the date of incident she went to the house of her grand-mother and
stayed there and on the next day she informed the matter to her aunt. She did

Spl. (P) Case No. 17/2014 Page 6 of 10
not report the matter to her grand-mother. From her evidence it also appears
that on the next day of the incident the matter was reported to police. So from
the above it appears that she informed the matter to Golapi Mura (P.W.5) and
Sunita Garh (P.W.6). However, from the evidence of P.W. 5 Golapi Mura it
appears that the victim has reported her regarding touching of her cheek only
by the accused. P.W. 5 specifically admitted that the victim did not tell her
about any misdeed by the accused except touching her cheek. On the other
hand, P.W. 6 Sunita Garh stated that while the victim was called to sleep at her
residence, the victim reported her that ‘accused told her indecent words’ and
except this victim did not alleged anything. So from the above evidence, it
appears that though victim has stated about the commission of misdeed by the
accused to them, but both the witnesses I.e. P.W. 5 and P.W. 6 did not support

the allegation of victim regarding commission of rape by the accused.

19. Coupled with above, if we look at the evidence of P.W. 7, the
medical officer, it appears that the victim was brought to him by police with
alleged history of sexual intercourse by one person two days back outside her
house. But upon examination of the victim PW 7 did not find any evidence of
recent sexual intercourse except a radish mark over mid-line of anterior aspect
of neck. In his cross PW 7 has admitted that such type of injury may cause by
fire wood. PW 7 has also admitted that in his report he has mentioned
regarding attempt of sexual intercourse based on the version of the victim. The
above finding of medical officer casts a serious doubt on the evidence of victim
so far is concerned. Has there been forceful sexual intercourse, certainly some

mark of violence could have been found on the private parts of the victim.

20. Apart from above, in his cross-examination, P.W. 8 has stated that
there was a village meeting and in the meeting the village elders found that the
allegation was false. P.W. 2, P.W. 3 and P.W. 4 are hearsay witnesses and they
have stated that they have heard from the victim regarding commission of
misdeed by the accused. On the basis of above materials it appears that the
evidence of the victim as stated by P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.4 did not get any

Spl. (P) Case No. 17/2014 Page 7 of 10
Support from the medical evidence and from the evidence of P.W.5 and P.W.6
to whom the victim has reported the matter soon after the occurrence. It

creates a huge doubt on reliability of the evidence of P.W.1, the victim.

21. In the course of argument hearing, learned Advocate for the
defence by referring to the cross examination part of the P.W.1 and P.W.2 has
argued that admittedly there was an ill relation between the accused and one
Romesh Phukan on some land dispute and at the instigation of said Romesh
Phukan, this false case was concocted. On looking at the cross examination of
P.W. 1, it appears that Romesh Phukan has accompanied her to the Police
Station as well as to court on the date of evidence and said Romesh Phukan
has some sour relation with the accused. P.W. 2 has admitted that he had
mortgaged some land to Romesh Phukan, but denied the giving of any land on
mortgage to the accused. He denied the defence suggestion that for the land

dispute, he has quarrel with the accused and filed this false case.

22. Further more, from the FIR and the evidence of P.W. 3 it appears
that accused has committed rape on the victim on two successive days, but the

victim or informant were silent on this aspect.

23. | found force in the submission of learned Advocate of the
accused that the evidence of the victim cannot be relied upon being not
corroborated by the witnesses namely P.W. 5 and P.W. 6 to whom she has
reported the matter immediately after the occurrence and thus accused is
entitled to the benefit of doubt. The argument of learned P.P. regarding
applicability of Section 29 of POCSO Act 2012 cannot be applied in this case in

view of apparent contradictions in evidence of victim.

24. Last but not the least on the list of reason to disbelieve the
evidence of victim it is an admitted fact that, the alleged incident of penetrative
sexual assault took place on 16.03.2014 and 17.03.2014 but FIR was lodged
only on 25.03.2014 that too at the initiative of I/C, Sepon Out Post after

publication of news item in the local news paper. No explanation was given by

Spl. (P) Case No. 17/2014 Page 8 of 10
the informant for causing delay in lodging the FIR. It also creates a suspicion

on the genuineness of the case.

25. To sum up the discussions, | am of the opinion that the evidence
of victim alone by using presumption u/s 29 of Pocso Act cannot be relied upon

being not trustworthy. Accused is entitled for the benefit of doubt.

26. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the ingredients of charge U/S 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 or any other
minor offence against the accused Sri Miton Sabar @ Ravan and he is acquitted
from the charge U/S 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

27 Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety are extended for
another six months from today U/S 437-A Cr.P.C

28. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357-A Cr.P.C.

29. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Charaideo U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

30. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case Is disposed of on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 22" day of March
