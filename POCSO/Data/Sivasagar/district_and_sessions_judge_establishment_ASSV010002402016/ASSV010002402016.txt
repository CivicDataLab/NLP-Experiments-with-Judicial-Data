POINT FOR DETERMINATION IS_-

6. (1) Whether on 16.03.2016, accused has committed sexual assault

on the victim 'X'?
DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF :

7 P.W. 1 the victim X, in her evidence deposed that while she was a
Student of class 10, on the date of the incident, she went to tuition at the
residence of the accused. For doing some wrong home works, accused pat her.
On this incident, she informed the matter to her parents and out of anger, her
father lodged the FIR. She gave her statement in court vide Ext. 1. In her cross
examination she admitted that she was not misbehaved by the accused. Due to
punishing her, she got angry.

Spl. (P) Case No.6 of 2016 Page 2 of 5
8. P.W. 2 Md. Ahidur Rahman, the father of the victim, in his
evidence deposed that on 16.03.2016, his daughter victim X in crying condition,
on returning from the house of the accused after taking tuition. She told him
that her teacher has patted her. On this out of anger, he lodged the FIR as Ext.
2. In his cross examination he deposed that he is not interested to proceed the

case.

9. P.W. 3 Safia Begum, the mother of the victim, deposed that her
daughter told him that her tuition teacher has patted her. She also deposed
that due to miss understanding, her husband filed this case. Accused did not

committed any misbehaviour to her daughter.

10. PW-4 SI Tuniram Neog (I/O) of this case deposed in detail about
the investigation done by him PW 4 also proved the sketch map of the PO as
Exbt. 3, charge sheet as Exbt. 4, medical report of the victim as Exbt. 5 and the
seizure list by which birth certificate of the victim was seized as Exbt. 6. In his
cross-examination, he admitted that he has not examined any of the family
members of the accused. As per medical examination report, no injury was

found.

11. From the above evidence on record, particularly from the evidence
of victim (PW 1), it appears that except her, there was no eye witness of the
occurrence. In her evidence-in-chief she categorically stated that for doing
some wrong in the home work her teacher, accused pet her. In her cross-
examination, she admitted that accused did not misbehaved her. The above
fact was confirmed by the P.W. 2 and P.W. 3, the parents of the victim. P.W. 3
in her evidence admitted that due to some misunderstanding of the fact, her
husband lodged the FIR. P.W.2, the father of the victim admitted that out of
anger, he lodged the FIR against the accused and presently he is not interested

to proceed with this case.

12. During 313 Cr.P.C. examination, the accused has admitted that
due to non-completing the home work, he has scolded the victim. He also
Spl. (P) Case No.6 of 2016 Page 3 of 5
admitted that he did not misbehave the victim and he has to scold only to

improve her education, but the matter was taken otherwise by the victim.

13. From the evidence of the victim as well as her parents it Is
apparent that due to some miscommunication the FIR was lodged. From the
categorical admission of the victim, it is apparent that there was no
misbehavior by the accused and the ingredient of sexual intent on the part of
the accused-teacher is missing during the incident of pet/scolding the victim.
Sexual intent is the core ingredient for an offence U/S 8 of POCSO Act.

14. From the above discussions, | am of the considered opinion that
prosecution has totally failed to prove the ingredients of offence U/S 8 of
POCSO Act, 2012 or any other minor offence against the accused beyond
reasonable doubt. As such, accused Ashok Kalita is acquitted from the charge
U/S 8 of POCSO Act and set at liberty forthwith.

15. The bail bonds executed by the accused and his surety stand

extended for another six months from today.

16. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357-A Cr.P.C.

17. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

18. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of

on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 17" day of J une,
2017 at Sivasagar.
