On examination, he found that Exh. No. Sero-3770/A gave positive test

report and statement given by victim in Court. On completion of investigation,
S| Ujjal Goswami have submitted charge sheet against the accused u/s 376
IPC. Exbt. 9 is the charge sheet. In his cross examination, PW-8 deposed that
as mentioned in the FIR, the incident was of 06.02.2017 and FIR was lodged on
08.02.2017, on return of the victim. He denied that at the time of filing of FIR,

victim came to Lakuwa OP with the informant. During investigation, he has not
Spl. (J) Case No. 2/2017 Page 6 of 10
collected any school certificate of the victim for determining the age of the
victim. He has not collected any age documents of the victim. He denied that,

he has not investigated the case properly under the provision of Pocso Act.

16. From the above evidence on record, let me decide the points

formulated above for just decision of this case.

17. Point No. IL: So far age of the victim is concerned, the informant
in his evidence as PW 1 claimed that victim was aged about 16 years and
proved the school certificate as Exbt.1 in which date of birth is mentioned as
29.06.2001. While adducing evidence in Court on 06.09.2018, the victim
claimed her age as 17 years and stated that she read up-to class-II! but cannot
say her date of birth. PW 5 Dr. Duplay Patir, the M.O. basing on the radiological
report, particularly complete fusion of both wrist joint and elbow joint has
opined that on the date of examination i.e. on 08.02.2017 the victim was aged
above 18 years. Except this, there are no other evidence on age of the victim.
Admittedly PW 8, the 1.0. of this case did not collect any document on age of
the victim. On looking at the Exbt. 1 the school certificate, it appears that Exbt.
1 does not bear any serial number or book number or even issue date. From
Exbt. 1 school certificate, it appears that the victim left the school after passing
class-lV exam. From the above, it appears that no reliance can be placed on
Exbt. 1 school certificate. As such, | have no option but to look at the medical
report of the victim which discloses that on the date of examination, as per
radiological report, the victim was aged above 18 years. Law Is well settled that
when there is two sets of evidence, the evidence favouring the accused should
be accepted. In this case the radiological report appears to be more convincing,
the same is accepted and accordingly | hold that the on the date of incident

victim was aged above 18 years.

18. Point No. II: So far role of the CCL is concerned, in her evidence the
victim stated that the CCL took her with him and kept her inside Bagan for one
night. On the next day morning the CCL left the place and the victim returned

home and informed the matter to her father. In her cross, she admitted that

Spl. (J) Case No. 2/2017 Page 7 of 10
she has love affairs with the CCL for last about one year and admittedly while
going with the CCL she did not make any hue and cry. From this part of
admission, it appears that the victim on her own and without any inducement
from the CCL went inside the jungle. Taking of the victim to the jungle however

iS not a crime.

19. The other part of this story is that as per the victim, inside Bagan
the CCL has committed misdeed with her, but she did not disclose what she
meant the term misdeed. On looking at the evidence of PW 1, it appears that
the incident happened on 06.02.2017 and he filed the FIR on 08.02.2017 and
after filing of the FIR, at evening hours the victim returned home and disclosed
that the CCL took her with him and kept her inside Bagan. PW 1 is totally silent
regarding reporting of the matter by the victim about commission of misdeed
on her by the CCL though the victim has categorically stated that after
returning home, she informed the matter to her father and thereafter her father

lodged the FIR. This is a huge contradiction.

20. So far time of return of the victim from J ungle is concerned, in the
course of argument hearing, learned Advocate has pointed out that this is a
false case just to frame against the accused with a view to take revenge of
previous incident in which mother of the victim left her matrimonial home and
now residing with the elder brother of the accused. This part of allegation as
brought by defence has admitted by the PW 1 and PW 2. In their evidence both
PW 1 and PW 2 categorically admitted that prior to this incident, mother of the
victim left her home and now residing with the elder brother of the accused.
The other witnesses namely PW 3 and PW 4 has met the victim at the P.S. and
they are seizure witnesses of the wearing apparels of the victim. PW 6 is a
hearsay witness and heard the incident from police. Admittedly PW 3, PW 4 and
PW 5 nowhere stated that they came to know about the incident from the
victim. PW 5 the M.O. has also mentioned that he did not find any symptom of
recent sexual intercourse. PW 7, the expert from FSL though stated that on the
leggings sent for FSL examination get positive test of human semen, but as the

victim is silent regarding physical relation with her by the CCL, it cannot be said
Spl. (J) Case No. 2/2017 Page 8 of 10
with conclusive proof that the semen found on her leggings belongs to CCL. No
DNA profile was done to match the semen found on the leggings. Moreover the
Said leggings was seized on 08.02.2017 and the sample was received by FSL
Guwahati with letter dated 17.02.2017. There is nothing on record for showing
delay as to where the seized leggings was kept. Though charge of rape on the
victim was framed, but as the victim was totally silent about commission of any
such activities on her against her will, | am of the opinion that it cannot be
presumed that the victim was subjected to penetrative sexual intercourse/rape
by the CCL. The victim being major and having not said about use of any force
during commission of the alleged misdeed, it should be presumed that if at all
there was any physical relation with the victim by the CCL the same took place

with her consent.

21. Considering all above, | hold that prosecution has failed to prove
the ingredients of charges u/s 376 (2) IPC and Section 4 of POCSO Act 2012
against the CCL. As such, the CCL is acquitted from the charges u/s 376 (2) IPC
and Section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

22. Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety stand extended

for another six months from today u/s 437-A Cr.P.C.

23. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to

DLSA for granting compensation u/s 357-A Cr.P.C.

24. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar u/s 365 Cr.P.C.

25. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case Is disposed of

on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 24" day of April,
2019 at Sivasagar.
