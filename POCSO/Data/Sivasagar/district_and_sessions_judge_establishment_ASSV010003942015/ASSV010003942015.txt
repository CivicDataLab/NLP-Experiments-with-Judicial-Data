7. PW-1 Dr. Prasanta Pratim Sarma in his evidence deposed that on

10.04.2015 he examined victim D in-connection with Joysagar Out Post G.D.
Entry No. 173 dated 10.04.2015. The victim has slurred speech and upon

years and there was no marks of violence on her person and does not have any

Sign of recent sexual intercourse. He proved his report as Ext. 1.

8. PW-2 Sri Abhijit Konwar, father of the victim in his evidence
deposed that in the month of February, 2015 while victim D was alone in the
house and he and his wife returned from fishing, his daughter informed them
that both the accused persons have committed rape on her. They saw bleeding
injuries. They brought victim D to hospital and filed the FIR vide Ext. 2. At that
time victim D was aged about 13 years. In his cross-examination, he denied the
defence suggestion that before police, he has not stated that on seeing
bleeding, victim D was taken to Sivasagar Civil Hospital at Joysagar. He
admitted that on 19.03.2015 victim D was brought to J oysagar Civil Hospital.
The FIR was lodged on 05.04.2015. Prior to this occurrence, accused Pranjal @
Babu Borah stayed near to his house and Babu Bora has bamboo orchard near
to his land. He used to sell trees of his land in which accused Babu @ Pranjal
helped him. However, after half finish, Babu did not come. He denied that as he
cut some trees belongs to Babu, there was a quarrel between them. He also
used to sell fish and people used to visit his house for purchasing fishes. He
admitted that his wife filed FIR against his father for committing rape on her

and trial of that case was finished.

9. PW 3 victim D in her evidence stated that on the date of
occurrence the accused persons after lying her, committed misdeed. In her
cross-examination she stated that on that day after closing the door the
accused persons make fun. She denied to have deposed falsely on being

tutored by her parents.

10. PW 4 Sri Padmeswar Konwar, grand-father of the victim in his
evidence deposed that in the month of Bohag on knowing regarding admission

of victim D in hospital he went to the hospital and on asking, the victim told him

Spl. (P) Case No. 8/2015 Page 3 of 11
that accused persons grabbed her. In his cross-examination, he stated that as
he has difference of opinion with the father of the victim, he used to reside
separately. He admitted that his daughter-in-law filed one false case alleging

rape against him.

11. PW 5 Smti. Aiti Konwar, grand-mother of the victim, in her
evidence deposed that on knowing information of bleeding of her grand-
daughter, she sent her husband to meet her at hospital. In her cross she also

Stated that she lived separately.

12. PW 6 Smti. Ritamoni Konwar, mother of the victim, in her
evidence deposed that while she along with her husband and other two
daughters went for fishing by keeping victim D alone in the house, both the
accused persons came and after committing physical relation, make the victim
D pregnant. On stopping of menstruation, on being asked victim D reported to
her that accused Pranjal Borah and Kulati Phukan @ Pankaj has committed
sexual relation with her and made her pregnant. On this incident her husband
lodged FIR. In her cross-examination, she stated that she could not say about
the date of birth of the victim. Victim D told them that the incident took place
on 20.02.2015. FIR was lodged on 08.04.2015. She was taken to hospital on
19.03.2015 on suspicion of menstrual bleeding. She was present while
Statement of victim D was recorded by Magistrate during investigation. She also
admitted that Kulati Phukon has an orchard near their land. She denied that

investigation of Sivasagar PS case No. 334/15 victim was sent for medical
examination and also sent to Court for recording her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C.
He went to the place of occurrence i.e. residence of informant and take
photograph of the PO. Exbt. 3(i) and 3(ii) are the photographs of the residence

of the victim and the campus. FIR named accused Sri Pankaj Kumar Phukan

Spl. (P) Case No. 8/2015 Page 4 of 11
and Pranjal Bora were apprehended. He collected the medical report and
Statement given by victim in court. Exbt. 4 is the statement of the victim given
in court u/s 164 Cr.P.C. On completion of investigation, he submitted charge
Sheet against the accused persons. Exbt. 5 is the charge sheet. In his cross-
examination the I/O has affirmed that witness Abhijeet Konwar in his statement
before police did not state that on seeing bleeding injury, he took the victim to
J oysagar Hospital. In the FIR there was mention that the delay in FIR was due
to remain busy in treatment of the victim. However no document of medical
treatment was given to him. He did not seize wearing apparel of the victim. In
the medical report, no pregnancy was found. Except parents and grandparents,
he did not examine any independent person as witness as none was found
there. In Exbt. 4 there was mention of accused as Babu and Kulati. There was
no mention of Pankaj Kr. Phukan and Pranjal Bora. In Exbt. 3 photographs
there was no mention of neighbours as no residence was found nearby. In the
medical examination report, there was no mention of mental of physical
disability of the victim. He did not collect any other certificate showing disability

of the victim.

14. CW - 1 Dr. Pradeep Mili in his evidence deposed that on being
authorised by Superintendent of Sivasagar Civil Hospital he appeared with the
called for OPD patient register of 19.03.2015. As per the records, victim D
appeared at Sivasagar Civil Hospital OPD on 19.03.2015 at about 11.10 am and
after examination, he got her admitted at M & G ward. She appeared at the
OPD with history of bleeding per vagina. On clinical examination, he found
pallor +++ (sever Anaemia). However no active bleeding was seen per vagina.
As per record, she remained in hospital ward from 19.03.2015 till 22.03.2015
and she got discharged on 22.03.2015 against medical advice. Exbt. X is the
OPD register. Exbt. X(i) is the relevant entry dated 19.03.2015. (proved in
Original). He has also brought the OPD and Emergency register of 20.02.2015.
From said register, it appears that victim D did not appear on that day either at

OPD or at Emergency after closing of OPD. Exbt. Y is the OPD register

Spl. (P) Case No. 8/2015 Page 5 of 11
containing entries of 20.02.2015. Exbt. Y(i) is the entries showing details of
patient examined on that day. Exbt. Z is the Emergency register containing
entries of 20.02.2015. Exbt. Z(i) is the entries showing details of patient
examined on that day. In his cross-examination, CW 1 deposed that some time
bleeding per vagina may be a Gynological problem. On 19.03.2015 the victim
did not give any history of rape with her or the cause of bleeding per vagina. If
forcible sex is made by two persons with girl, normally injury in vagina should

occur and hymen got torn.

15. On the basis of above evidence, let me discuss the points

formulated to decide the fate of this case.

16. Point No.I_: So far age of the victim is concerned, from the medical
evidence, it appears that on the date of examination, the victim was found
above the age of 16 years but below the age of 18 years. The informant in his
evidence as PW 2 claimed that at the time of incident the victim was aged
about 13 years. In the FIR also age of the victim was mentioned as 13 years.
PW 3 the victim while adducing evidence (deposing on 17.09.2015) claimed her
age as 13 years. PW 4 & PW 5 the grandparents and PW 6, the mother of the
victim are totally silent on age of the victim. From the evidence of PW 7, the 1.0.
it appears that he did not collect any document relating to age of the victim.
However, during cross examination defence did not challenge on age of the
victim that at the time of alleged incident victim was below the age of 18 years
but above 12 years of age. As such, | have no hesitation to hold that on the

date of alleged incident the victim was aged about 13 years.

17. Point No. Il: So far allegation of penetrative sexual assault on the
victim on 20.02.2015 by the accused persons is concerned, in the course of
argument hearing, learned Advocate for the accused has submitted that there
was abnormal delay in filing the FIR and explanation given in the FIR was
totally contradicting the evidence of the informant. It is further argued that
though the allegation of rape was mentioned in the FIR and during evidence

the allegation of pregnancy was brought, but during evidence, the victim simply

Spl. (P) Case No. 8/2015 Page 6 of 11
Stated about committing misdeed without explaining the detail meaning of
terminal misdeed; rather in her cross the victim has admitted that the accused
persons were make fun with her only. It is further argued that medical report
Shows that hymen of the victim was present and no injury mark was found on
the private parts of the victim. Even the medical report shows that while
recording the brief history of the alleged incident, only the term sexual assault
was mentioned which does not mean rape. It is further argued that as per the
evidence of the informant, on the date of incident itself, they came to know
about the alleged incident of rape from the victim and immediately she was
taken to Hospital on finding some bleeding injuries. However PW 6 gave a
different version and stated that on stopping menstruation, on 19.03.2018
victim was taken to hospital. CW 1, the M.O. who came to court with the
medical record shows that the victim was taken to Sivasagar Civil Hospital OPD
on 19.03.2015 due to her bleeding per vagina and upon clinical examination,
the victim was found suffering from severe anemia and on that day no
allegation of rape was made while giving brief history of ailments. Basing on
this, learned Advocate for the accused has submitted that the allegations as
brought in the FIR are concocted, baseless and fabricated just to harass the
accused persons out of previous grudge. Learned Advocate for the accused has
also referred about of lodging false case by the mother of the victim against her
father-in-law. On the other hand, learned Special P.P. has argued that delay in
lodging the FIR should not be treated as fatal because in such nature of cases,
it is quite possible that victim might not disclose such type of incident. Learned
Special P.P. has also submitted that though the victim did not narrate about the
details of the misdeed on her, but her evidence may be treated for committing
sexual assault though not penetrative sexual assault. | have considered the

Submission of both the sides.

18. From the evidence of PW 2, it appears that on returning from
fishing, he and his wife came to know that accused persons has committed

rape on the victim. They also found bleeding injury and immediately victim was

Spl. (P) Case No. 8/2015 Page 7 of 11
brought to Sivasagar Civil Hospital. In his cross though he denied that before
police he has not stated about finding bleeding injury and taking the victim to
Sivasagar Civil Hospital at Joysagar, but this fact was confirmed by the |.0. In
his cross PW 2 admitted that victim was taken to Sivasagar Civil Hospital on
19.03.2015 which was however duly corroborated by CW 1, the M.O. who
proved the medical examination record of the victim. From the evidence of PW
3 the victim, it appears that she is totally silent regarding rape on her, rather in
her cross she stated that accused persons committed fun with her. PW 6, the
mother of the victim however told a different story. She has stated that on
knowing about bleeding of the menstruation, on asking the victim informed her
that the accused persons by committing rape on her, made her pregnant. On
this, the victim was taken to Hospital and case was lodged. PW 4 and PW 5, the
grand-parents of the victim simply stated that on knowing about hospitalization
of the victim, PW 5 the grand-mother sent her husband PW 4 to Hospital and
on going to Hospital PW 4 came to know from the victim that accused persons

grabbed the victim.

19. From the above evidence on record, it appears that three different
version came out through victim, her father, her mother and grand-father of
the victim who all came to know about the incident from the victim. As per the
PW 2 he came to know about the incident on the same day, whereas PW 6
came to know about the incident of rape on victim only on stopping of
menstrual period of the victim; whereas PW 4 is silent regarding rape on victim
and only stated about grabbing of the victim while she was hospitalized. From
the evidence of CW 1, the M.O. of Sivasagar Civil Hospital, who came to court
with hospital record of OPD Register dated 19.03.2015 shows that the victim
was brought to hospital with a history of bleeding per vagina and upon clinical
examination, the victim was found suffering from severe anemia and she was
hospitalized for three days and was discharged against medical advice. The said
CW 1 in his evidence specifically stated that neither in the OPD Register nor in

the Emergency Register of the hospital there was no entry to show that on

Spl. (P) Case No. 8/2015 Page 8 of 11
20.02.2015, the victim was brought to Sivasagar Civil Hospital either at OPD or
at Emergency. From the cross examination of CW 1, it appears that even on
19.03.2015 the victim did not give any history of rape on her by the accused
persons or cause of bleeding per vagina. Thus the evidence of PW 2 and PW

did not find any corroboration and contradicting each other.

20. Apart from above, the delay aspect in filing the FIR appears to be
fatal under the facts and circumstances of the case as discussed above. Even if
knowing the incident of rape either on 20.02.2015 by the PW 2 or on
19.03.2015 by the PW 6, no FIR was lodged instantly. Thus, it makes a huge

doubt on the allegation as brought against the accused persons.

21. So far possibility of false implications as argued by defence, it is
in the cross examination of PW 2 that they have some dispute regarding
cutting of bamboo in the orchard of PW 2. PW 6 has also corroborated this. As
such, in view of above fact, | am of the opinion that it is not a fit case for
invoking Section 29 of POCSO Act 2012 to draw presumption on the allegation

brought against the accused persons.

22 Moreover the victim is totally silent regarding rape on her.
Though she stated about some misdeeds with her by the accused persons but
in her cross examination she totally turned aside and stated about making fun
with her by the accused persons. As such, it cannot be said that on the alleged
date of incident, i.e. on 20.02.2015, the victim was subjected to penetrative

sexual assault by the accused persons.

23. In absence of any convincing evidence, the argument of learned
Special P.P. regarding relying on the evidence of victim for sexual assault on

her is also found not reliable and convincing.

24. From the above discussions, it appears that prosecution has
miserably failed to prove the allegation of penetrative sexual assault or any
other minor offence on the victim on 20.02.2015 by the accused persons

beyond all reasonable doubt.

Spl. (P) Case No. 8/2015 Page 9 of 11
25. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the ingredients of charge u/s 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 against the
accused persons. As such, accused Sri Pranjal Bora and Sri Pankaj Kumar
Phukan are acquitted from the charge u/s 4 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at
liberty forthwith.

26. Bail bond executed by the accused persons and their sureties

are extended for another six months from today U/S 437-A Cr.P.C.

27. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is not
a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S 357-
A Cr.P.C.

28. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

29. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on
contest.
30. Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 28" day of

November 2018 at Sivasagar.
