6. PW1 (XXX) being the alleged victim girl, had deposed in her
evidence that on the day of the alleged occurrence, she was
going to her grandmother’s house and there was a bamboo
bridge on the way. The bridge was broken. The accused was
going behind her. As she was moving ahead through the
bridge, she was about to fall down but the accused had caught
hold of her hands and saved her from falling down. The
accused helped her to cross the bridge. She narrated this
incident to her mother but she mistook it and filed this case
against the accused. She had also deposed that the accused
did not do any foul act with her.

7. PW2 (YYY) being the mother of the alleged victim girl had
deposed the same facts as stated by her daughter but she had
further stated that some of her neighbors had instigated her to
file a case against the accused and out of mistaken belief and
misunderstood facts, she filed this case. PW2 had further
deposed that neither her daughter told her anything offensive
against the accused not did the accused do any foul act with
her daughter.

8. Thus, from the aforesaid evidence of the witnesses including
the alleged victim girl, it appears that there is nothing in the
evidence to show that the accused had committed any offence
as alleged and charged in this case. It rather transpires that
this case is a result of instigation by the neighbors and also a
result of misunderstanding. Thus, the case of the prosecution
is bound to fail. The accused is hence, not found guilty of
any offence and as such, acquitted of the charges and
set at liberty forthwith.

9. Forward a copy of this judgment to the District Magistrate in
compliance of Sec.365 CrPC.
