JUDGMENT

1. Prosecution case in brief is that on 11.10.2017, the informant Sri
Amal Biswas lodged a complaint before learned CJM, Morigaon alleging inter-
alia that on 22.05.2017, at day time at about 12 O’clock, when he was not
present in his house and other family members were busy in their household
works, the accused persons named in the complaint came to his house in

motorcycle and accused Sri Anil Biswas with the help of other accused

Pocso Case No. 40/2019 Page 1of5
kidnapped his minor daughter, the victim ‘X’ (name withheld), aged about 13
years from the courtyard of his house. It is also alleged that after kidnapping
the victim girl was kept confined at unknown place and accused Anil Biswas had

committed rape upon the victim ‘x’.

2. On receipt of the complaint, the same was forwarded to the
Officer-in-Charge, Jagiroad Police Station for registration of a case, and
accordingly, Jagiroad PS Case No. 428/2017 u/s 366(A) IPC r/w Section 3/4 of
the POCSO Act was registered and investigated into. During investigation, on
04.01.2019 statement of the victim was recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. The victim
was also forwarded for medical examination but she refused to undergo
medical examination. On completion of investigation, the Investigating Officer
(I/O) submitted charge sheet against the accused Sri Anil Biswas only for trial
u/s 363 IPC r/w Section 4 of the POCSO Act, 2012 r/w Section 10/11 of the
Protection of Child Marriage Act by showing him as absconder. The other
accused persons as named in the FIR were not sent up for trial due to lack of

evidence against them.

3. On appearance of accused Anil Biswas he was allowed to go on
bail and after furnishing copies of relevant papers, vide order dated 11.02.2020,
upon hearing both the sides, charges u/s 366/376(2)(i) IPC r/w Section 6 of the
POCSO Act, 2012 were framed and explained to the accused to which he
pleaded not guilty.

4. During trial, prosecution side has examined only two witnesses
only i.e. the informant and the victim. Considering the nature of the evidence,
examination of accused u/s 313 Cr.P.C is dispenses with. I proposed to dispose
the case by using powers u/s 232 Cr.P.C. without calling the accused to enter

into defence.

5. I have heard argument of Id. Special P.P. Mr. A. Kalam and Mr. U.
C. Roy, learned defence Counsel and gone through the evidence on record. I
have considered the submission of both the sides.

POINTS FOR DETERMINATION ARE:

6. (D) What was the age of the victim on 22.05.2017?

(II) Whether on 22.05.2017, the accused has kidnapped/abducted the

DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF
7. PW-1, Sri Amal Biswas, the informant as well as the father of the
victim ‘X’ in his evidence deposed that at the time of incident, the victim ‘X’ was
aged about 16 years and was a student of class VIII. He has forgotten the date
of birth of his daughter. On 22.05.2017, at about 12 noon, VDP Dipak Patar
informed him that his daughter was missing. On knowing this, he returned
home to search his daughter but did not find his daughter. On this, after 5-6
months, he lodged the compliant through court. Exbt. 1 is his COmplaint. After
about a year days, his daughter and accused Anil returned to their house.
Police was informed and they were taken to Jagiroad PS. Police handed the
victim to him. She did not state anything about her stay of one year. After
staying for about 3 months, his daughter again went with the accused.
Presently she is residing with the accused at his house without performing
social marriage. In his cross-examination by defence, PW 1 stated that he has
not submitted any age proof document in court. He had stated the age on
assumption. He denied the suggestion that at the time of occurrence his
daughter was aged above 18 years and as such, he had withheld the age proof
documents of his daughter. He has no knowledge about performing marriage
between the accused and his daughter. Presently, they have compromised the
matter and he will accept their relationship subject to the condition that
accused shall keep his daughter happily. He has no objection in acquittal of the

accused from this case.

8. PW-2, the victim ‘X’ in her evidence deposed that at the time of
incident, she was aged about 18 years and was a student of class IX. She has
forgotten her date of birth. On 22.05.2017, at about 3 PM, having love affairs

Pocso Case No. 40/2019 Page 30f5
with the accused, she eloped with him without informing her parents. Accused
took her to Mumbai and they stayed in his relative’s house for about year. After
return to the house of accused, police brought her to Jagiroad PS. Police also
took her for medical examination and brought to Court for recording her
statement. She had given her statement in Court. Exbt. 2 is her statement.
Exbt. 2(1) is her signatures. From court, she went with her parents. After 10
days, she came back to the house of accused Anil and performed marriage in
the house of maternal uncle of accused and now living with her husband.
Presently, she is carrying 9 months pregnancy. In her cross-examination by
defence, she stated that she had love affairs with accused Anil Biswas. He did
not use force in taking her to Mumbai. They stayed there on her consent.
Accused is mason by profession and her father is businessman. Therefore, he
did not like the accused and hence he filed the case without asking her. She

prays for acquittal of the accused.

9. Basing on the above evidence, let me decide the points
formulated. So far age of the victim is concerned, it has been revealed from the
evidence of the victim claimed that, at the time of occurrence she was aged
about 18 years. However father of the victim though stated that at that time
victim as aged about 16 years, but in his cross-examination, he admitted that
he stated the age on assumption. Admittedly no document was proved by
prosecution age. Medical examination was refused by the victim. As such, it is

presumed that at the time of incident, the age of the victim above 18 years.

10. From the evidence of PW-2, the victim ‘xX’, it appears that she
deposed nothing against the accused involving him with the alleged offence of
kidnapping and committing rape upon her by the accused. The victim in her
evidence-in-chief clearly stated that having love affairs with the accused, she
eloped with him without informing her parents and stayed at Mumbai for about
a year. There is evidence that the victim eloped with accused on 3 occasions
and lastly performed marriage with him and residing at her matrimonial home.
Presently, she is carrying 9 months pregnancy. In her cross-examination, the

victim admitted that accused did not use force in taking her to Mumbai and that
Pocso Case No. 40/2019 Page 40f 5
she stayed there on her consent. PW 1 in his evidence admitted that after
recovery, the victim did not tell him anything about her stay with accused.
There is no evidence of use of force or any misbehave by the accused on the
victim.

11. From the above evidence as discussed, it is clear that there is no
material whatsoever regarding abduction or commission of rape by the accused
upon the victim ‘xX’. The victim being major in age, offence under Pocso Act is

not applicable in this case.

12. Considering above discussion, I am of the opinion that prosecution
has failed to prove the ingredients of charge U/S 366/376(2)(i) IPC and Section
6 of the POCSO Act against the accused Anil Biswas. As such, accused Anil
Biswas is acquitted from the charges U/S 366/376(2)(i) IPC and Section 6 of
POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

13. The bail bond executed by accused and his surety are extended

for another six months from today u/s 437-A Cr.P.C.

14. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to

DLSA for granting compensation u/s 357-A Cr.P.C.

15. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Morigaon u/s 365 Cr.P.C.

16. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 7" day of March,
2020 at Morigaon.
