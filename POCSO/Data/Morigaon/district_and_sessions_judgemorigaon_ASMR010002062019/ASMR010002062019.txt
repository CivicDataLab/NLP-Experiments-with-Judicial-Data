ss Prosecution case in brief is that on 04.09.2018, the victim ‘xX’
(name withheld) stated to be aged 16 years lodged a FIR with the Morigaon

Pocso Case No. 15 of 2019 Page 1 of 5
Police Station alleging inter-alia that on the previous day i.e. on 03.09.2018, at
about 8:00 PM, while she was standing in front of her house, accused Md.
Motibur Rahman came there riding a motorcycle and touched her private parts
and also torn her wearing clothes. Upon raising hue and cry, when the accused

tried to flee away, the locals apprehended him along with his motorcycle.

2. On receipt of the FIR, Morigaon PS Case No. 429/2018 u/s 354(A)
IPC r/w Section 12 of the POCSO Act, 2012 was registered and investigated
into. During investigation, the victim was medically examined and also
forwarded to the Court for recording her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. The
Investigating Officer also seized one motorcycle bearing Registration No. AS-21-
E-7921, one Soluwar Kurta and one school certificate of the victim. On
completion of investigation, the Investigating Officer (I/O) submitted charge
sheet against the accused Motibur Rahman for trial u/s 354 IPC r/w Section 12
of the POCSO Act, 2012.

3. It may be mentioned herein that during investigation, the accused
was arrested on 04.09.2018, and vide order dated 10.10.2018, he was allowed

to go on bail.

4. On 01.03.2019, charge sheet was laid before this Court and vide
order dated 26.09.2019, charges u/s 354 IPC r/w Section 8 of the POCSO Act,

2012 were framed and explained to the accused to which he pleaded not guilty.

5. During trial, prosecution side examined only two witnesses i.e. the
the victim ‘X’ and her father. Considering the nature of their evidence (PW-1
and PW-2), examination of accused u/s 313 Cr.P.C is dispenses with and I
proposed to dispose the case by using powers u/s 232 Cr.P.C. without calling

the accused to enter into defence.

6. I have heard argument of Id. Special P.P. Mr. A. Kalam and Mr. A.
Shahnewaz and Mr. H. Rahman, learned defence counsel and gone through the

evidence on record. I have considered the submission of both the sides.

POINTS FOR DETERMINATION ARE:

Pocso Case No. 15 of 2019 Page 2 of 5
7 @& Whether the accused has committed offence punishable u/s 354

IPC?
(II) Whether on 03.09.2018, the victim 'X' was subjected to sexual
assault by the accused?

DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF

8. PW-1, Sri J. Bangthai, the father of the victim in his evidence
deposed that, at the time of incident victim was aged about 17 — 17 % years
and a student of Class-X. On 03.09.2018, at about 7:00 PM, while his daughter
went to roadside for urination, suddenly the accused by driving one motorcycle
knocked his daughter. Upon hue and cry, the locals apprehended the accused
with his motorcycle. The police was informed and the accused was handed over
to police. In his cross-examination, by defence, he stated that at the time of
the incident, there was flood and they were taking shelter on the roadside. He
also stated that while his daughter sat on the roadside to attend nature’s call,
suddenly the motorcycle touched her body and she made hue and cry. He was
also standing nearby. He had not seen the incident of knocking his daughter by
the motorcycle driven by the accused as it was dark. He also stated that the
accused did not misbehave with his daughter and presently he has
compromised the matter with the accused.

9. PW-2, the informant cum victim ‘X’ in her evidence deposed that
she was born in the year 2002. On 03.09.2018, at about 7:00 PM, while she
went to roadside for walking, suddenly the accused by driving one motorcycle
knocked her from backside. She fell down and got minor injuries. On her hue
and cry, locals apprehended the accused with his motorcycle. Then police was
informed and the accused was handed over to police. She had lodged one FIR
vide Ext. 1. Police took her for medical examination and also brought to the
Court for recording her statement. Ext. 2 is her statement given u/s 164 Cr.P.C.
In her cross-examination by defence, she stated that at the time of the
incident, her sister was with her. She stated that except knocking her with the
motorcycle, the accused did nothing with her. Her wearing cloth was torn due

to the accident with the motorcycle. She cannot say about the contents of the

Pocso Case No. 15 of 2019 Page 3 of 5
FIR as the same was written by other. Without reading the contents of the FIR,
she just put her signature. Her father was also standing nearby. She further
stated that the accused did not misbehave with her. Presently she has
compromised the matter with the accused.

10. Basing on the above evidence on record, let me decide the points.
So far age of the victim is concerned, the victim and her father claimed that at
the time of incident, the victim was aged about 17 years. This fact remained

unrebutted during cross-examination by defence.

11. So far point no. II i.e. alleged incident of sexual assault is
concerned, from the evidence of the PW-2, the victim cum informant, it
appears that she deposed nothing against the accused involving him with the
alleged offence of outraging her modesty or committing sexual assault upon
her. The victim in her evidence-in-chief clearly stated that on 03.09.2018, at
about 7:00 PM, while she went to roadside for walking, suddenly the accused
by driving one motorcycle knocked her from backside. She fell down and got
minor injuries. On her hue and cry, locals apprehended the accused with his
motorcycle. In her cross-examination by defence, she stated that except
knocking her with the motorcycle, the accused did nothing with her. Her
wearing cloth was torn due to the accident with the motorcycle. Accused did
not misbehave with her. PW-1, the father of the victim in his evidence
supported the evidence of the victim. Accused by driving one motorcycle
knocked his daughter. Upon hue and cry, the locals apprehended the accused
with his motorcycle. In his cross-examination, he admitted that he was
standing nearby and that accused did not misbehave with his daughter.

12. Considering the evidence as discussed above, it is clear that there
is nothing in the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 against the accused for the
alleged offence of outraging modesty and sexual assault. In the instant case,
ingredient of offence u/s 354 IPC and Section 8 of the POCSO Act, 2012 are
totally missing.

13. Considering above discussion, I am of the opinion that prosecution

has failed to prove the ingredients of charge U/S 354 IPC and Section 8 of
Pocso Case No. 15 of 2019 Page 4 of 5
POCSO Act against the accused Md. Matibur Rahman. As such, accused Matibur
Rahman is acquitted from the charges U/S 354 IPC and Section 8 of the POCSO
Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

14. The bail bond executed by accused and his surety are extended

for another six months from today u/s 437-A Cr.P.C.

15. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to

DLSA for granting compensation u/s 357-A Cr.P.C.

16. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Morigaon u/s 365 Cr.P.C.

17. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 20" day of
February, 2020 at Morigaon.
