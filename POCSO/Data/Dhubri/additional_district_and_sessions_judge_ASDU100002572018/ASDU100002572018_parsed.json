Order on sentence will be passed at 03.30 pm. Later on, 29.03.2019Convicted accused Gauri Shankar Nath @ Banka is again produced before the court at 03.30 p.m. I have heard Ld. defence counsel as well as Ld. Special P.P. for the State on the point of sentence. Ld. Special P.P submitted deceased victim child was 7 years old, there was no provocation, victim child was defenseless, victim was unarmed and she did not get chance to safe her, this is a cold blooded murder, accused to eliminate the victim murder the defenseless child, accused to full fill his carnal lust committed rape on the girl in presence of another toddler of less than three years of age and this is the first of its nature case took place at Bilasipara subdivision and is the rarest of rare case and prays for highest punishment of the accused.Learned defence counsel submitted accused is young and no past history of crime brought against the accused hence, prays for leniency. After hearing ld. counsel for the defence and Ld. Special P.P. and upon entire scrutiny of evidence on record I find that the mitigating fact has no force, weight in comparison to the aggravated facts and young age of the accused in this case not out weight the aggravating factor of the helpless, defenseless 7 years old girl child who was rape and murdered. When one 7 years old girl is not safe in the society in presence of the accused, the other adult woman of the society is not at all safe in the society in presence of the accused in the society and collective conscience of society and consciousness of the court is shocked and shivered by the crime committed by the accused and keeping in view the settled principle of law set by Hon&amp;amp#039ble Apex Court in Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab and Machhi Singh and Ors I find that this is the case falling in the category of &amp;amp#039rarest of rare cases&amp;amp#039 so to award the death penalty u/s 302 I.P.C as imprisonment for life is foreclosed in the case and death penalty is only option for safer society.

As such I am of the considered opinion that if convicted accused Gauri Shankar Nath @ Banka is sentenced u/s 376-AB IPC it will also serve the purpose of section 6 of the POCSO Act.

Special P.P. for the State on the point of sentence. Ld. Special P.P submitted deceased victim child was 7 years old, there was no provocation, victim child was defenseless, victim was unarmed and she did not get chance to safe her, this is a cold blooded murder, accused to eliminate the victim murder the defenseless child, accused to full fill his carnal lust committed rape on the girl in presence of another toddler of less than three years of age and this is the first of its nature case took place at Bilasipara subdivision and is the rarest of rare case and prays for highest punishment of the accused.Learned defence counsel submitted accused is young and no past history of crime brought against the accused hence, prays for leniency.

Special P.P submitted deceased victim child was 7 years old, there was no provocation, victim child was defenseless, victim was unarmed and she did not get chance to safe her, this is a cold blooded murder, accused to eliminate the victim murder the defenseless child, accused to full fill his carnal lust committed rape on the girl in presence of another toddler of less than three years of age and this is the first of its nature case took place at Bilasipara subdivision and is the rarest of rare case and prays for highest punishment of the accused.Learned defence counsel submitted accused is young and no past history of crime brought against the accused hence, prays for leniency. After hearing ld. counsel for the defence and Ld. Special P.P. and upon entire scrutiny of evidence on record I find that the mitigating fact has no force, weight in comparison to the aggravated facts and young age of the accused in this case not out weight the aggravating factor of the helpless, defenseless 7 years old girl child who was rape and murdered. When one 7 years old girl is not safe in the society in presence of the accused, the other adult woman of the society is not at all safe in the society in presence of the accused in the society and collective conscience of society and consciousness of the court is shocked and shivered by the crime committed by the accused and keeping in view the settled principle of law set by Hon&amp;amp#039ble Apex Court in Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab and Machhi Singh and Ors I find that this is the case falling in the category of &amp;amp#039rarest of rare cases&amp;amp#039 so to award the death penalty u/s 302 I.P.C as imprisonment for life is foreclosed in the case and death penalty is only option for safer society.

As such I am of the considered opinion that if convicted accused Gauri Shankar Nath @ Banka is sentenced u/s 376-AB IPC it will also serve the purpose of section 6 of the POCSO Act.

Later on, 29.03.2019Convicted accused Gauri Shankar Nath @ Banka is again produced before the court at 03.30 p.m. I have heard Ld. defence counsel as well as Ld. Special P.P. for the State on the point of sentence. Ld. Special P.P submitted deceased victim child was 7 years old, there was no provocation, victim child was defenseless, victim was unarmed and she did not get chance to safe her, this is a cold blooded murder, accused to eliminate the victim murder the defenseless child, accused to full fill his carnal lust committed rape on the girl in presence of another toddler of less than three years of age and this is the first of its nature case took place at Bilasipara subdivision and is the rarest of rare case and prays for highest punishment of the accused.Learned defence counsel submitted accused is young and no past history of crime brought against the accused hence, prays for leniency.

Special P.P. and upon entire scrutiny of evidence on record I find that the mitigating fact has no force, weight in comparison to the aggravated facts and young age of the accused in this case not out weight the aggravating factor of the helpless, defenseless 7 years old girl child who was rape and murdered. When one 7 years old girl is not safe in the society in presence of the accused, the other adult woman of the society is not at all safe in the society in presence of the accused in the society and collective conscience of society and consciousness of the court is shocked and shivered by the crime committed by the accused and keeping in view the settled principle of law set by Hon&amp;amp#039ble Apex Court in Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab and Machhi Singh and Ors I find that this is the case falling in the category of &amp;amp#039rarest of rare cases&amp;amp#039 so to award the death penalty u/s 302 I.P.C as imprisonment for life is foreclosed in the case and death penalty is only option for safer society.

When one 7 years old girl is not safe in the society in presence of the accused, the other adult woman of the society is not at all safe in the society in presence of the accused in the society and collective conscience of society and consciousness of the court is shocked and shivered by the crime committed by the accused and keeping in view the settled principle of law set by Hon&amp;amp#039ble Apex Court in Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab and Machhi Singh and Ors I find that this is the case falling in the category of &amp;amp#039rarest of rare cases&amp;amp#039 so to award the death penalty u/s 302 I.P.C as imprisonment for life is foreclosed in the case and death penalty is only option for safer society.

As such I am of the considered opinion that if convicted accused Gauri Shankar Nath @ Banka is sentenced u/s 376-AB IPC it will also serve the purpose of section 6 of the POCSO Act. Accordingly for the offence committed by the accused u/s 6 of POCSO Act which is equivalent to the offence u/s 376-AB IPC, I deem it fit to sentence the accused u/s 376-AB of the Indian Penal Code and same will do the justice.

Special P.P. for the State on the point of sentence. Ld. Special P.P submitted deceased victim child was 7 years old, there was no provocation, victim child was defenseless, victim was unarmed and she did not get chance to safe her, this is a cold blooded murder, accused to eliminate the victim murder the defenseless child, accused to full fill his carnal lust committed rape on the girl in presence of another toddler of less than three years of age and this is the first of its nature case took place at Bilasipara subdivision and is the rarest of rare case and prays for highest punishment of the accused.Learned defence counsel submitted accused is young and no past history of crime brought against the accused hence, prays for leniency.

Later on, 29.03.2019Convicted accused Gauri Shankar Nath @ Banka is again produced before the court at 03.30 p.m. I have heard Ld. defence counsel as well as Ld. Special P.P. for the State on the point of sentence. Ld. Special P.P submitted deceased victim child was 7 years old, there was no provocation, victim child was defenseless, victim was unarmed and she did not get chance to safe her, this is a cold blooded murder, accused to eliminate the victim murder the defenseless child, accused to full fill his carnal lust committed rape on the girl in presence of another toddler of less than three years of age and this is the first of its nature case took place at Bilasipara subdivision and is the rarest of rare case and prays for highest punishment of the accused.Learned defence counsel submitted accused is young and no past history of crime brought against the accused hence, prays for leniency. After hearing ld. counsel for the defence and Ld. Special P.P. and upon entire scrutiny of evidence on record I find that the mitigating fact has no force, weight in comparison to the aggravated facts and young age of the accused in this case not out weight the aggravating factor of the helpless, defenseless 7 years old girl child who was rape and murdered. When one 7 years old girl is not safe in the society in presence of the accused, the other adult woman of the society is not at all safe in the society in presence of the accused in the society and collective conscience of society and consciousness of the court is shocked and shivered by the crime committed by the accused and keeping in view the settled principle of law set by Hon&amp;amp#039ble Apex Court in Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab and Machhi Singh and Ors I find that this is the case falling in the category of &amp;amp#039rarest of rare cases&amp;amp#039 so to award the death penalty u/s 302 I.P.C as imprisonment for life is foreclosed in the case and death penalty is only option for safer society.

As such I am of the considered opinion that if convicted accused Gauri Shankar Nath @ Banka is sentenced u/s 376-AB IPC it will also serve the purpose of section 6 of the POCSO Act.
