8. DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASON THEREOF:-

I have gone through the FIR, the evidence on record and also
considered the submissions of the learned Special Public Prosecutor and also
the learned counsel of the accused persons. The informant, PW-1 in his
evidence stated that his daughter had love affair with Abjajul Islam and

presently she married with Abjajul Islam and living as husband and wife.
4
PW-2, the victim stated in her evidence stated that she had love affair with
Abjajul Islam. Now she married with the accused person. Due to
misunderstanding, her father lodged the FIR.The evidence on record does
not discloses the ingredients of Sec.120(B)/376(3)/34 I.P.C. Accordingly, the
accused persons are aquitted from the charges under Section
120(B)/376(3)/34 I.P.C and set at liberty, forthwith.

The bail bond of the accused person shall remain in force for a period
of six months in terms of Section 437A Cr.P.C.
