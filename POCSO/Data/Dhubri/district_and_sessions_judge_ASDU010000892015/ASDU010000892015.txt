JUDGMENT

The prosecution case in brief is that on 02-03-2014 accused
Golam Hussain Sk. in the absence of informant Marjina Bewa came to her house
and committed rape upon the minor daughter of the informant and the accused
had threatened the daughter of the informant following the act that if she dared
to divulge about the alleged occurrence to anyone, the accused would kill her
and burry her for which, the daughter of the informant did not divulge about the
alleged occurrence to her mother. The daughter of the informant had confided in
her mother about the alleged occurrence when her mother seeing her
deteriorating physical condition had enquired about the cause of such illness and
thereafter FIR was lodged on 05-03-2014.

2. A case was registered by the O.C, Tamarhat Police Station on 05-
03-2014 u/s.376 (2) of I.P.C. R/W Sec. 4 of POCSO Act, 2012. The I.0. had filed
charge sheet against accused Golap Hussain u/s.376 (2) of I.P.C. and 8 of POCSO
Act. However, charge was framed only u/s.376 (2) of I.P.C. against the accused
Golap Hussain. Charge had been read over, explained and interpreted to accused

to which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4. Prosecution had examined as many as 11 (eleven) witnesses.
Considering there being no incriminating evidence against the accused, the

necessity to examine the accused u/s.313 of Cr.PC is done away with.
Point for determination

Whether on 02-03-2014 accused had committed rape upon the

victim?

5. PW-1, Musstt. Morjina Bewa, the mother of the victim and the
informant in the case admitted to have lodged the FIR. However, in her cross-
examination she admitted to accused being her immediate neighbour and to

existence of a long standing land dispute with the accused.

6. PW-2, the victim Mafuja Khatun admitted to the accused being the
elder brother of her father and has not implicated the accused of having

committed rape on her in any manner and whatsoever.

7. PW-3, Md. Osman Goni Sk., PW-4 Musstt. Lalbhanu Bewa, PW-5
Zakir Hussain, PW-6 Joynal Sk all being immediate neighbours of the informant
denied having knowledge about the alleged occurrence. PW-7, Abu Taher and
PW-8, Abdus Sattar Sk. who live around 1 2 k.m. away from the house of the
informant had been declared hostile and no portion of their evidence before the
Court is in support of the prosecution version and the portion of the evidence in
respect of which these two witnesses had been declared hostile had not been
proved by the I.0. and in cross-examination both of them having been

interrogated by the police during investigation.

7. PW-10, Dr. Anjumanara Ahmed, had ruled out any trace of recent

sexual intercourse in her opinion in ext-1, report bearing her signature ext-1 (1).

8. PW-11, SI (UB) Shahab Uddin Ahmed, the I.0. had admitted to
have not seized wearing apparel of the victim she had worn at the time of the

alleged occurrence.

9. Now considering the evidence of the informant, the victim and the
Medical Officer, I find not an iota of evidence against the accused Golap Hussain.
Considering the mother admitting land dispute with her brother-in-law and
accused being the elder brother of her husband, the present case having been
brought against the accused out of previous enmity cannot be ruled out in
absence of any incriminating evidence against the accused person. The medical
evidence though found the hymen of victim torn in her examination but ruled out
any sign of recent sexual intercourse and in her opinion hymen is torn by any

other means apart from the sexual intercourse.

10. Thus summing up the entire discussion of the prosecution
evidence on record, it is evident that the prosecution has failed to establish the
prosecution case against accused Golap Hussain beyond all reasonable doubt.

The accused is accordingly acquitted and set at liberty forthwith.

Given under my hand and seal of this court on this the 27" day

of January, 2016.
