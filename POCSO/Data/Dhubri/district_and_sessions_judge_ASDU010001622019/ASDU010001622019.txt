U/s.376(3) I.P.C.

(ii) Whether the accused on 17.7.018 at 11-00 in the morning
at village Kalabari under South Salmara Police Station committed
penetrative sexual assault on the daughter of the informant 'X'
and thereby committed offence U/s.4 of POCSO Act.

DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF :
10. In this prosecution case, PW-1 Momin Seikh is the informant,
PW-2 Kamala Khatun is the wife of the informant PW-1, PW-3 'X' is
the alleged victim, PW-4 Sakina Khatun and PW-5 Monira Begum
are independent witnesses.
11. Now let us see the evidence available on record.

PW-1 Momin Seikh has stated in his evidence that he is the
informant in this case. The occurrence took place 3/4 months ago.
On the day of occurrence, he went for his work. When he returned
to his house, his wife told him that the accused called 'X' and took
to his house. Accordingly, he lodged the ejahar against the
accused. He gave thumb impression on the ejahar.

In his cross, PW-1 has stated that the accused used to visit

their house and 'X' also used to visit the house of the accused. He
lodged the ejahar due to misunderstanding.
12. Â©PW-2 Kamala Khatun has stated in her evidence that the
occurrence took place 3/4 months ago. On the day of occurrence,
the accused took 'X' to his house. When her husband got to know
about it he lodged the ejahar against the accused.

In her cross, PW-2 has stated that the case was lodged only

because of misunderstanding.

Contd. Page-4.
13. PW-3 'X' has stated in her evidence that informant is her
father. The accused did not do anything against her. He only took
her for walk. She gave her statement before the Magistrate, Ext-1
is the statement, Ext-1(1) is her signature.

Cross examined of PW-3 was declined by the defence.
14. PW-4 Sokina Khatun has stated in her evidence that the
accused took 'X' to his house. But she did not know the rest.

Cross examination of PW-4 was declined by the defence.
15. PW-5 Monira Begum has stated stated in her evidence that
the accused took 'X' to his house. She did not know the rest.

Cross examination of PW-5 was declined by the defence.
16. Thus, careful scrutiny of evidence of PW-1 to PW-5 shows
that PW-1 Momin Seikh who is the informant has unequivocably
has stated that he lodged the ejahar due to misunderstanding. The
accused only took 'X' to his house and when he (PW-1) got to know
about it he lodged the ejahar against the accused. PW-2 sternly
denied to do any sexual intercourse on 'X' by the accused.

Same is the evidence of PW-3 'X', the alleged victim. She
denied to do sexual intercourse on her by the accused. According
to PW-3, she only went to the house of the accused with intent to
visit his house. So, there found no incriminating evidence adduced
by PW-3 against the accused.

17. PW-2 Kamala Khatun is the mother of PW-3 'X' who has
stated in her plain language that the accused took her daughter,
but he did not do anything on her.

Same is the evidence of PW-4 Sokina Khatun and PW-5 Monira
Begum. Both PW-4 and PW-5 have stated in the same tune that the
accused took 'X' to his house and except this they knew nothing.
So, the evidence of PW-4 and PW-5 has no effective value.

Contd. Page-5.
18. Thus, the evidence as projected by prosecution is not
sufficient and satisfactory to establish the offences as alleged
against the accused. The prosecution evidence is found dearth of
merit.
19. The prosecution has failed to prove it's case U/s.376(3) I.P.C
and U/s.4 of POCSO Act against the accused beyond all reasonable
doubt.
20. Held, the accused is not guilty U/s.376(3) I.P.C and U/s.4 of
POCSO Act.
21. The accused is acquitted and set at liberty. The bail bond
stands cancelled and the bailor is discharged from all liabilities.
The case is disposed of.
Given under my hand and seal of the court on this 20"
March, 2019.
