DECISION AND REASONS THERE OF
9. In this prosecution case P.W-1 Mamoni Begum is the informant, P.W-2
‘x’ is the alleged victim, P.W-3 Manjura Bibi, P.W-4 Dul Hussain, P.W-5 Jibrail
Hussain, P.W-6 Majnur Rahman, P.W-7 Mostafa Hussain, P.W-8 Bipija Khatun
are independent witnesses. P.W-9 Dr. Rinku Ahmed is the Medical and Health
Officer and P.W-10 Ajit Kr. Ray is the Investigating Officer.

10. Since P.W.-1 Mamoni Begum is the informant and P.W.-2 ‘x’ is the

Contd. to page no. 4
[4]

alleged victim, so both are prime witnesses, so let’s see the evidence of this
two witnesses, at first.

11. P.W-1 Mamoni Begum has stated in her evidence that she is the
informant in this case. She lodged the ejahar, Ext-1 against the accused. The
occurrence took place 2 (two) and '% (half) years ago (from the date of
adducing evidence on 03-06-2019). On the day of occurrence she went to the
house of her uncle Yunus Ali at Lakhiganj. Her daughter x was also with her. X
was loitering in the court yard. Thereafter she became traceless. She informed
the village headman. The village headman asked her to lodge ejahar.
Accordingly, she lodged the ejahar, Ext-1. Next day ‘x’ was found out. She

rN

asked the victim ‘x’. ‘x’ told her that someone took her away. She suspected
the accused to take away her daughter, so, lodged the ejahar Ext-1 against
the accused. Ext-1(1) is her signature.

In cross P.W-1 has stated that the ejahar was not read over to her.

The accused did not commit voluptuous act on x.
12. P.W-2 ‘x’ has stated in her evidence that the informant is her mother.
She does not know the accused. The occurrence took place 2 2 years ago
(from the day of adducing evidence on 03-06-2019). On the day of occurrence
she went to the house of uncle. Her mother was working in the kitchen room
at the time of occurrence. She was loitering in the courtyard. At that moment,
someone had taken away her holding her from behind. She, on way, pushed
the accused away and she went her maternal uncle’s house. The person did
not commit sexual assault on her. She gave her statement before the
Magistrate, Ext-2 is the said statement, Ext-2(1) her signature.

In her cross P.W.-2 has stated that she could not identify the person

who had taken away her. The accused did not commit sexual intercourse on
her. She could not recollect what she had stated in her statement, Ext-2.
13. Thus, careful scrutiny of evidence of P.W-1 and P.W-2 shows that both
P.W-1 and P.W-2 failed to identify the accused. P.W-2 ‘x’ who is the alleged
victim has stated that she could not identify the person who had taken away
her. P.W-1 has stated that P.W-2 did not tell her the name of the person who
had taken away her. So, both P.W-1 and P.W-2 have clearly stated in their
evidence that they failed to identify the accused.

Next question arises whether the accused committed sexual
intercourse on P.W-2 ‘x’.

Contd. to page no. 5
[5]

P.W-2 ‘x’ has vehemently denied to commit sexual intercourse on her
by the accused. In her evidence P.W-2 has stated that when she was taken
away, she pushed the person and she took shelter in her maternal uncle’s
house. So the evidence of P.W.-2 is clear that the accused person did not
commit sexual intercourse on her.

Thus, the evidences of both P.W-1 and P.W-2 is not inculpatory
against the accused. They have adduced evidence not incriminating the

accused.

14. P.W-9 Dr. Rinku Ahmed who examined the health of P.W-2 ‘x’ has also
not supported the prosecution that there was sexual assault on ‘x’. In her
evidence P.W-9 has stated that she found no sign of sexual intercourse or
assault on ‘x’.

So the evidence of P.W-9 is that there was no sexual intercourse or

assault on P.W-2 ‘x’.
15. Now let’s see the evidence of other witnesses.

P.W-3 Manjura Bibi has stated in her evidence that she knows nothing
about the occurrence.

Her cross examination was declined by the defence.

P.W-4 Dul Hussain has stated in his evidence that the informant gave
a proposal for marriage between ‘x’ and the accused. As ‘x’ was minor, so the
marriage did not hold. Accordingly this case was lodge against the accused.

Cross examination of P.W.-4 was declined by the defence.
16. P.W-5 Jibrail Hussain has stated in his evidence that he got know that
someone kidnapped ‘x’. But he did not Know who had kidnapped her.

Cross examination of P.W-5 was declined by the defence.
17. P.W-6 Majnur Rahman has stated in his evidence that he knows
nothing about the occurrence.

Cross examination of P.W-6 was declined by the defence.
18. P.W-7 Mostafa Hussain has stated in his evidence that he knows
nothing about the occurrence.

Cross examination of P.W-7 was declined by the defence.
19. P.W-8 Bipija Khatun has stated in his evidence that she knows nothing
about the occurrence.

Cross examination of P.W.-8 was declined by the defence.

20. Thus, scrutiny of evidence of P.W. 3 to P.W.-8, it appears that all the

Contd. to page no. 6
[6]

witnesses have categorically stated in their evidence that they know nothing
about the occurrence. P.W-5 Jibrail Hussain has stated in his evidence that he
got to know that ‘x’ was kidnapped by someone. But he did not know who
kidnapped ‘x’. So, his evidence is also imbibed with ambiguity. The other
witnesses have categorically denied to know about the occurrence. So, the
evidence of P.W.-3 to P.W.-8 have not effective value to consider the
prosecution case.
21. The evidence of P.W-10 Ajit Kr. Ray the investigating officer, is mere
official. He investigated the case. This evidence of P.W.-10 will not meliorate
the prosecution case.
22. Taking above all into consideration, it appears that the prosecution
evidence is not sufficient and reliable to prove the offences as alleged against
the accused. The prosecution case is found dearth of merit.
23. The prosecution has failed to prove its case under section
366(A)/376(2)(i) of I.P.C and under section 4 of POCSO Act against the
accused beyond all reasonable doubt.
24. Held, the accused is not guilty under section 366(A)/376(2)(i) of I.P.C.
and under section 4 of POCSO Act.
25. The accused is, accordingly, acquitted and set at liberty.

The bail bond of accused stands cancelled and the bailor is discharged
from all liabilities.

The case is disposed of.

Given under my hand and seal of this court on this 10° day of
February, 2020 at Bilasipara, District- Dhubri.
