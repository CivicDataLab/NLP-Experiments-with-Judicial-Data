DECISION AND REASONS THERE OF

9, In this prosecution case P.W-1 ‘x’ is the alleged victim, P.W-2 Sahinur
Islam is the informant, P.W-3 Nosimuddin is the father of the informant,
P.W-4 Dr. Aruna Saikia and P.W-7 Dr. Laskar Ali are Medical & Health
Officer. P.W-5 Hashina Khatun and P.W-6 Mafizul Rahman are independent
witnesses. P.W-8 Dipak Kr. Sarkar is the investigating officer.

10. Since, P.W-1 ‘x’ is the alleged victim and P.W-2 Sahinur Islam is the
informant, so, both are the prime witness in this case. Let us now go
through the evidence of this two witnesses.

11. P.W-1 ‘x’ has stated in her evidence that the informant Sahinur Islam
is her brother and the accused is her maternal uncle. The occurrence took
place 3/4 months ago (from the date of adducing her evidence on 12-03-
2019). Her parent rebuked her as she did not read properly. So, she wanted

to go to her grandmother’s house at Goalpara. Accordingly she went to

Contd. to page no.-4
[4]

Nayahat. She was waiting for bus at Nayahat bus stoppage. The accused
met her there. He was also going to Goalpara. Both of them, accordingly,
went to Goalpara. They reached the house of her grandmother and leaving
her there, the accused went somewhere. When the accused got to know,
ejahar was lodged against him, he took her to her parent’s house and
dropped her there. She gave her statement before the Magistrate, Ext-1 is
the said statement, Ext-1(1) is her signature.

In her cross P.W-1 has stated that she did not tell her parents when
she left for Goalpara. The accused did not take her forcibly. The accused did
not do any evil act on her. She gave the statement Ext-1 under stress.
12. P.W-2 Sahinur Islam has stated in his evidence that he is the
informant in this case. ‘x’ is his sister. The occurrence took place 3/4 months
ago (from the date of adducing his evidence on 12-03-2019). His sister was
missing. His sister was seen with the accused. His sister did not return to
house. Accordingly, he lodged the ejahar Ext-2 against the accused, Ext-2
(1) is his signature.

In his cross P.W-2 has stated that due to misunderstanding, he
lodged the ejahar against the accused.
13. Thus, meticulous scrutiny of evidences of P.W-1 ‘x’ and P.W-2
Sahinur Islam it appears that both of them have adduced not incriminating
the accused. According to P.W-1 ‘x’, the accused did not force her to go with
him nor he did any evil act on her. The accused and she herself went to her
grandmother’s house. When she left for Goalpara, she did not inform her
parents and this led her brother to lodge the ejahar against the accused. It
was only because of misunderstanding. Same is the evidence of P.W-2
Sahinur Islam. According to P.W-2, he lodged the ejahar due to
misunderstanding. The accused did not took his sister forcibly and he did
nothing against ‘x’.

So, the evidence of P.W-1 and P.W-2 is not inculpatory against the
accused.
14. Now, let us see the evidence of other witnesses.

P.W-3 Nosimuddin is the father of the ‘x’ who has stated in his
evidence that he rebuked his daughter ‘x’ and she went to her

grandmother's house at Goalpara. She went with the accused.

Contd. to page no.-5
[5]

In his cross P.W-3 has stated that the accused is his brother-in-law.
The ejahar was lodged due to misunderstanding.

15. P.W-5 Hashina Khatun has stated in her evidence that she knows
nothing about the occurrence. Cross examination of P.W-5 was declined by
the defence.

16. P.W-6 Mafizul Rahman has stated in his evidence that he got to know
that ‘x’ was missing from her house. After a few days, she came back. On
being asked, she told that she went to visit her relatives. Except this he
knew nothing.

Cross examination of P.W-6 was declined by the defence.

17. Thus, careful scrutiny of evidence of P.W-3, P.W-5 and P.W-6 shows
that all the witnesses have adduced evidence not incriminating against the
accused. P.W-3 Nosimuddin, who is the father of the victim has stated that
due to misunderstanding, the ejahar was lodged against the accused. His
daughter ‘x’ went to her grandmother’s house. As she went without
informing them. So, they lodged the ejahar on suspicion. So, the evidence of
P.W-3 not inculpatory against the accused.

The evidence of P.W-5 is that she knows nothing about the
occurrence. The evidence of PW-6 is that he got to know that ‘x’ was
missing.

Thus, the evidence of P.W-3, P.W-5 and P.W-6 is found without
merit. Such evidence will never meliorate the prosecution case.

18. The evidence of P.W-4 Dr. Aruna Saikia, the Medical & Health Officer
shows that she found no sign of rape on ‘x’.

19. The evidence of P.W-7 Dr. Laskar Ali, the Medical & Health Officer,
shows that ‘x’ was between 16 to 17 years old at the time of occurrence.

20. P.W-8 Dipak Kr. Sarkar is the investigating officer. His evidence is
mere official. The evidence of P.W-8 will not meliorate the prosecution case.
21. Taking above all into consideration, it leads to conclusion that the
prosecution evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused kidnapped
‘x’, ‘x’ was committed rape by accused or accused committed penetrative
sexual assault on ‘x’. The evidence of prosecution witnesses is not convincing
to establish the offences as alleged against the accused. The prosecution

case is found dearth of merit.

Contd. to page no.-6
[6]

22. The prosecution, thereby, has failed to prove it’s case u/s
366(A)/376/506 I.P.C and u/s 4 of POCSO Act against the accused beyond
all reasonable doubt.
2 Held, the accused is not guilty u/s 366(A)/376/506 I.P.C and section
4 POCSO Act.
24. Accordingly, the accused is acquitted and set at liberty.

The bail bond of accused stands cancelled and bailor is discharged
from liabilities.

The case is disposed of.

Given under my hand and seal by this court on this 23" day of July,
2019 at Bilasipara, Dist- Dhubri.
