locked him from outside; that accused rubbed coconut oil on her
private part; that accused touched her private part with his penis; that
accused came outside by breaking the lock of the door of his bathroom;
that accused slapped her after coming out of the bathroom and after
that she went to the house of Md. Hasan Ali; that wife of Md. Hasan Ali
told her not to disclose the fact to anyone and that after the incident
many people assembled and her father came and took her to the police
station”.

Smt. Renu Keot [PW-3] during her statement under Section 161
Cr.P.C. did not state before him that “while she was coming from her work
place she noticed many people gathering at the house of Md. Hasan Ali;
that she could hear that one girl was weeping and that girl was her
victim daughter; that her husband came earlier to the house of Md.
Hasan Ali; that he met police at the house of Md. Hasan Ali and that
victim stated before her that accused rubbed coconut oil on her private
part”

Witness Md. Ritu Ali [PW-4] during his statement under Section 161
Cr.P.C. did not state before him that “he witnessed the accused inserting
coconut oil over the buttocks of the victim and seeing the incident he
returned back to the shop premise of his owner; that he narrated the
incident before the Managers of the shop namely Sri Moon Phukan and
Sri Debajit Saikia”.

The 1.0. further confirmed that witness Sri Babu Bhuyan [PW-5]
during his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. did not state before him that “at
the time of incident he was loading sand in the truck vehicle alongwith
one Bharat Mirdha and that he witnessed the accused dragging the

victim inside his shop premise”.

It is further confirmed by the I.0. that witness Sri Bharat Mirdha
[PW-6] during his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. did not state before him
that “on the date of incident he was loading sand in the vehicle; that the
accused dragged the victim by holding her hand inside his shop
premise and that he witnessed accused in indulging bad work with the
victim inside his shop premise. This witness further stated that he did
not state before police that he witnessed Md. Ritu Ali coming towards

the shop premise of accused to purchase diesel”.

25). From a close perusal of the evidence on record it is seen that the
statement of the victim [PW-2] was recorded by the learned Magistrate on
14/08/2017 wherein she has disclosed that the accused took her towards his
bathroom and thereafter rubbed coconut oil over his penis and thereafter
pressed his penis over her buttocks. She somehow released from the clutches of
accused and thereafter locked the door of the bathroom from outside. The
accused broke open the door of the bathroom and thereafter assaulted her, for

which, she out of fear ran towards the house of Md. Hasan Ali.

26). In the case of Utpal Mishra —versus- State of Assam, 2015
[2] GLR 542, it has been held by the Hon’ble Gauhati High Court in Para No-
22 of its judgment as follows:
PARA NO-22

The principles of criminal jurisprudence are that:

a) There should be legal, reliable and unimpeachable evidence to
prove that the prosecution story “must be true” rather than
“may be true”;

b) It is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that more
serious the offence, stricter is the degree of proof;

c) Standard of proof in a criminal case: burden is always on the
prosecution and the same never shifts. Prosecution can never
derive any benefit from the weakness of the defence version;

d) Holding a witness “implicitly reliable” leads to denial of judicial

consideration of the infirmities in evidence;

SPECIAL CASE NO. 69 OF 2017

17
18

e) Defence witnesses cannot be disbelieved by relying on
conjectures and surmises: they are entitled to equal treatment
with those of the prosecution;

f) If two views are possible in a criminal case, the view favourable
to the accused should be accepted;

g) The averment/allegation with respect to the commission of
rape has got to be clear and specific for basing a finding of guilt
rather than being just inferential. The
evidence/averments/allegations must fulfill the ingredients of
offence of RAPE as defined under Section 375 of IPC;

h) The prosecution must prove the case in the manner in which
they are alleged to have been caused. It is elementary where
the prosecution has a definite and positive case, it must prove
the whole of that case;

i) In a case the prosecution leads two sets of evidence, each one
of which contradicts and strikes at the other and shows it to be
unreliable, the result would necessarily be that the court would
be left with no reliable and trustworthy evidence upon which
the conviction of the accused might be based. Inevitably, the

accused would have the benefit of such situation.

27). Keeping in mind the above rationale as laid down by the Hon’ble
Apex Court I am constrained to hold that the evidence adduced by the
prosecution in support of its case is nothing shorter than mere conjectures and

suspicion.

28). The accused in his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. stated that

victim has deposed falsely. He is innocent.
29). It is a well settled law that the conviction on the sole evidence of a

child witness is permissible, if such witness is found competent to testify and the

court, after careful scrutiny of its evidence.

SPECIAL CASE NO. 69 OF 2017

18
19

In the case of Datttu Ramrao Sakhare-versus-State of
Maharashtra, reported in [1997] 5 SCC 341, the Hon’ble Apex Court has held
that — “A child witness if found competent to depose to the facts and
reliable one, such evidence could be the basis of conviction. In other
words, even in the absence of oath, the evidence of a child witness can
be considered under Section 118 of Indian Evidence Act, provided that
such witness is able to understand the questions and able to give
rational answers thereof. The evidence of a child witness and credibility
thereof would depend upon the circumstance of each case. The only
precaution which the court should bear in mind while assessing the
evidence of a child witness is that the witness must be reliable one and
his/her demeanor must be like any other competent witness and there

is no likelihood of being tutored”.

30). The ratio as laid down in the above case is that the testimony of a
child witness is attributed the same kind of credibility that it attached to the
statement of any other witness if the testimony is consistent. However, in the
present case, the victim [PW-2] has not been found consistent on the material
particulars with regard to the incident. Further, there is no corroboration by the
witness Smt. Renu Keot [PW-3], independent witnesses namely Md. Ritu Ali [PW-
4|, Smt. Rumena Khatun [PW-7], Smt. Najima Sultana Rahman [PW-8] and
hostile witnesses namely Sri Babu Bhuyan [PW-5] and Sri Bharat Mirdha [PW-6].

31). In view of my aforesaid discussions in the foregoing paragraphs, I
am of the opinion that prosecution has not been able to prove the case against
accused Md. Aftabuddin Ahmed @ Aktabuddin under Section 376 [1] IPC as well
as under Section 6 of The Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
The circumstance of the case does not inspire the court to take a view that
conviction can be sustained based on the testimony of victim [PW-2] alone and in
absence of any corroborative material I hold that prosecution side has failed to

establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

SPECIAL CASE NO. 69 OF 2017

32). In the result, accused Md. Aftabuddin Ahmed @ Aktabuddin is
acquitted of the charges under Section 376 [1] IPC read with Section 6 of The
Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him on
benefit of doubt and he is set at liberty forthwith.

Accused is on bail. The bail bond of accused is extended for another

06 [six] months from today as per provision of Section 437-A Cr.P.C.

33). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 22nd day of
January 2019.
