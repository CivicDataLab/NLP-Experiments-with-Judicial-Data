JUDGMENT

The prosecution case, in brief, is that the informant lodged an

FIR with the Jirighat P.S. stating the facts that on 17.02.17 at about 4 p.m.
the victim sister of the informant went to a nearby shop but she did not
return. On search and inquiry the informant could know that the accused

along with other co accused abducted the victim. When the informant
Spl.(POCSO) Case No.49/17

communicated with the accused pointing on this matter, the accused gave
threatening to him.
2. On receipt of the FIR, O/c Jirighat PS registered a regular PS
case vide Jirighat P.S. Case No.09/17 U/S 366(A) of IPC . Police started
investigation and during the course of investigation the statement of the
victim girl was recorded U/S 164 Cr.P.C. The investigating officer visited the
place of occurrence and prepared a rough sketch map etc. and
subsequently after completion of investigation submitted charge sheet only
against accused person Arif Uddin U/S 366 A of IPC r/w Sec.6 of POCSO
Act.
3 As the offence is U/S 366 A of IPC r/w Section 6 of POCSO Act
being exclusively triable by the Court of Special court , Id. additional CJM
Cachar, Silchar sent the case record to this court and _ this case was
taken up for trial by this court. In due course, upon appearance of the
accused and after hearing both sides formal charge U/S 366 of IPC and
Section 4 of POCSO Act was framed by this court against the accused
person. The charges having been read over and explained the accused
pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

Points for determination :
4. Now, in the present case the points to be decided are :-

(1) Whether the accused person on 17.02.2017 at about 4 p.m.
at village- Chalitarthal under Jirighat PS had kidnapped the victim, the
sister of the informant with intent that she may be compelled to marry
against her will or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled to
marry against her will or in order that she will be forced or seduced to illicit
intercourse, as alleged?

allegations against him. Defence declined to adduce evidence.

DISCUSSIONS, DECISIONS AND REASONS THERE-OF

15. PW.8, Dr. Orina Raha, the Medical Officer, deposed in her
evidence that on 23.02.2017 she had examined the victim on police
requisition and PW.8 deposed that victim narrated history before PW.8
stating that three boys named Arif who was working in a_ hotel, Fakrul, a
driver and another unknown boy forcefully took her in a sumo vehicle
and gave her something to smell and she became unconscious and
after that when she gained consciousness found herself at the house of
Arif and Arif had sexual intercourse with her daily . PW.8 further
deposed that on the basis of physical including dental examination,
laboratory and radiological investigations done on victim and opined that
â€” (i) Her age is above 14 years and below 16 years ( ii ) No evidence of
recent sexual intercourse is detected and ( iii ) No evidence of injury on
the body or genitals detected.

16. In her cross examination the PW.8 admitted that she gave her
opinion regarding age on the basis of radiological report and she has
neither brought the said X-ray plate to the court today nor submitted the
same to the IO.

17. PW.9, Robjana Bibi, who is the mother of accused, deposed in
her evidence that about 2/ 2 & %2 years ago her son accused Arif Uddin
came to his house along with a girl ( i.e. the victim ) and thereafter the
said girl got married with her son socially in presence of well wishers and

Kaji and thereafter police came and apprehended the accused and after
SplI.(POCSO) Case No.49/17

the release of accused from jail both the families jointly celebrated their
marriage socially.

In his cross examination, PW.9 stated that at present the
accused and the victim have been living peacefully as husband and wife
and at the time of marriage the victim told her age as 19 years before
them and the villagers and Kaji.

18. PW.10 Najima Begum and PW.11- Haidar Hussain deposed in the
same manner stating that at the relevant date and time accused married
one girl and thereafter police arrested the accused. Both these above
witnesses stated in their cross examination that after release of the
accused from jail the parents of the victim and family of the accused
celebrated the marriage between the accused and the victim socially and
at present they have been living peacefully as husband and wife having
been blessed with one minor daughter.

19. PW-12 is the IO Sri Sanjeeb Kumar Das, who has narrated
various stages of investigation conducted by him and he submitted
charge sheet against the accused vide Ext.6 and Ext.6(1) is his signature.
PW-12 in his cross examination stated that he did not collect the birth
certificate or school certificate of the victim and did not enquire to know
in respect of loss of academic year of the victim due to failure.

20. Appreciating the evidence available on record as discussed
above, it reveals that the prime witness the victim PW.5 in her evidence
deposed that she voluntarily eloped with the accused and got married
with him out of love affair and presently she has been peacefully living
with the accused having blessed with a child. PW.1, the informant of the
case, being the brother of the victim deposed that he lodged the FIR as
he came to know that the victim was at the house of accused and at

that time victim was of above 18 years of age and in his cross
Spl.(POCSO) Case No.49/17

examination he stated that victim was socially married off with the
accused. PW.2, the mother of the victim also deposed that at the time of
occurrence age of the victim was 18 years and victim was married off
with the accused. PW.3 did not know anything about the occurrence.
PW.4 who is a reported witness though stated in her evidence that father
of the victim reported her that accused kidnapped the victim but in her
cross examination she categorically stated that she personally does not
know anything about the incident. PW.6, PW.7, PW.9, PW.10 and PW.11
did not implicate the accused in the alleged offence of crime. Though
PW.8, the Medical Officer deposed in her evidence that the victim gave
her history to PW.8 implicating the accused as discussed above but this
piece of evidence will not help to the case of the prosecution ,
particularly, in view of the evidence of victim PW.5 herself. So, it
appears from the discussions above that the victim eloped with the
accused voluntarily and got married with him and they have been now
peacefully as husband and wife.

21. As regards age of the victim, the informant PW.1, stated that
victim was of above 18 years age at the time of occurrence. PW.2, the
mother of the victim being guardian of the victim deposed that victim
was 18 years of age at the time of occurrence. PW.6, an independent
witness also stated that at the time of occurrence the sister of the
informant ( i.e. the victim ) was above 18 years. PW. 9, the mother of
the accused stated in his cross examination that at the time of marriage
the victim disclosed her age as 19 years before them and the villagers
and Kaji. The medical officer opined that age of the victim was above 14
years and below 16 years at the time of occurrence. So it appears that
there was no mention of the exact age in the medical report and there

may be variation of age of two years on either side. Moreover, the
Spl.(POCSO) Case No.49/17

Medical officer gave the opinion basing on radiological report but the X-
ray report was not submitted before the court. The prosecution side also
failed to produce the birth certificate or school certificate and the IO also
admitted in his cross examination that he did not collect the birth
certificate or school certificate of the victim. That being the position,
there is no option before this court , particularly in view of the oral
evidences as discussed above, than to hold that the victim was major at
the time of occurrence.
22. In view of the above observations and discussions made above, I
am of the opinion that the accused cannot be fastened with the alleged
offence of crime as leveled against him and deserves to be acquitted.
23. Upon consideration of all above the aspects, I hold that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case U/s 366 of IPC and Sec.
4 of POCSO Act against accused.
24. In view of the above, accused person is_ not held guilty and
stands acquitted of the charge leveled against him and he is set at liberty
forthwith.

Bail bond stands discharged.

Judgment is pronounced and delivered in the open court on
this the 27th day of February, 2020.
