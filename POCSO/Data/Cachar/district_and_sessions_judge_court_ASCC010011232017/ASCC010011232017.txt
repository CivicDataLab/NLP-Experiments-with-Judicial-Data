Spl.(POCSO) Case No.33/17

13.11.2017

All three accused persons are present. Three
PWs including the victim are present. They are
examined. Defence declined to cross-examine them.
They are discharged. Learned P.P. considering the
nature of evidence has submitted for closure of
prosecution evidence on the ground that examination
of any other witness would not improve the case
anymore. Sufficient force is found in the submission.
Hence, prosecution evidence is closed. Consideration
of the evidence on the record so recorded I would like
to proceed under Section 232 Cr.P.C. Accused persons
are examined. Heard argument of both sides.

In the instant case charge was framed
u/s.366/34 I.P.C. with the acquisition that on 01.08.15
at about 9 p.m. the accused persons kidnapped the
victim. The charge when read over and explained the
accused persons pleaded not guilty. Hence, trail
began. In support of the case prosecution examined
the complainant, the victim and her mother. According
to them, at the material time the victim was major and
the victim having love affair with accused Akhtar
Hussain voluntarily fled away with him. Subsequently,
the victim was given marriage with the accused and
both of them have been living as husband and wife
and out of their wedlock she gave birth of a female
child whose present age is around one year. Ext.2 is
the statement of the victim. She stated before the
Magistrate that she having love affair for previous two
years fled away with the accused and got married. At
that time she was 19 years.

That being the nature of evidence this Court
has got no option but to hold that prosecution case
fails for want of implicating evidence. Accused
