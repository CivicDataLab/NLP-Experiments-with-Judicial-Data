JUDGMENT

I. The prosecution Case in brief is that On 31.08.2017
complainant Shanti Mili lodged a written complaint with Gogamukh P.S.
alleging inter-alia that on 21.08.2017 at about 11.30 P.M. accused Raju
Doley entered into his house and attempted to commit rape on his
daughter by removing clothes of Miss Bhairabi (real name conceal) aged
about 15 years. His daughter raised alarm and he was Caught red handed.
It is alleged that €arlier also the accused attempted to commit rape on her
by entered into his house. It is stated that the complainant wanted to
settle the issue through discussion in Presence of villager elders but the
accused was absconding.

Zé. On receipt of the ejahar police registered a case vide
Gogamukh P.S. Case No.154/2017 u/s 376/511 of I.P.C. Police started
investigation and on completion of investigation submitted Charge-sheet
against the accused Raju Doley u/s 376/511 of I.P.C. Police also started
investigation on completion of investigation submitted charge-sheet
against the accused Raju Doley U/s. 10 of POCSO Act.

a The case came up before the learned J.M.F.C., Dhemaji on
appearance of the accused Id. J.M.F.C. furnished necessary copies to the
accused and committed the case to this Court for trial.

4. This Court on appearance of the accused considered the
materials on record and upon hearing both the sides, framed charge u/s
376/511 of IPC read with Section 8 of POCSO Act and read over and
explained to the accused to which he pleaded not guilty. The prosecution,
in order to prove its Case, examined 2 witnesses the victim and the
complainant. Thereafter the evidence was closed as the prosecution
submitted that the witnesses had not implicated the accused as to

commission of the offence..
o Points for determination :

 

(i) That you, on 25.08.2017 at about 11.30 P.M. at night at
Village-Adut Ligiragaon under Gogamukh Police Station attempted
to commit rape on Smt. Bhairabi Mili (real name conceal) inside
their house and thereby you committed an offence punishable u/s
376/511 of IPC.

(ii) That you, on the same day, time and place committed
sexual assault on Smt. Bhairabi Mili inside their house and thereby
committed an offence punishable U/s. 8 of the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

6. I have gone through the evidence on record and heard
arguments of both sides.

Discussion, Decision and Reasons thereof

i. Complainant as examined as PW1. In his evidence stated
that victim is his daughter. The occurrence took place in 2017 at night at
about 9 P.M. He also stated that his daughter had quarrelled with the
accused and the accused came to her house and rebut her daughter.
Then he filed a complaint against the accused. Ext.1 is complaint and
Ext.1(1) is signature.

8. The victim was examined as PW2. In her evidence stated
that there was quarrel between her and the accused and on the day of
occurrence the accused came to her house started shouting. Her father

lodged a complaint.

In cross-examination she stated that after filing of the case
they have amicably settled the matter with intervention of village elders.

Now, they are maintaining good relations.
9, I have considered evidence on record it appears that PWs in
their evidence have not specifically stated as to what happened in
between the accused and his daughter. PWs have also not stated
anything regarding involvement of the accused in the commission of the
alleged offence. PWs have also not supported the contents of the F.I.R. in

this case.

10 From the above, it is quite clear that the accused and the
PWs maintaining good relation and in the absence of any implications as
to the involvement of the accused in the alleged offence. I find that the

prosecution case cannot succeed and it fails.

11. In view of the above, I find that the prosecution has failed
to prove the charge u/s 376/511 of IPC and Section 8 of POCSO Act.
against the accused. I find the accused not guilty accordingly. He is
acquitted. Set him at liberty forthwith.

ORDER:

12. In view of the above, I find that the prosecution has failed
to prove the charge U/s. 376/511 of IPC and Section 8 of POCSO Act.
against the accused. I find the accused not guilty. Accordingly, he is
acquitted. Set him at liberty forthwith.

i3. Judgment is pronounced in open court.

14. Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this the 23rd
day of March, 2018.
