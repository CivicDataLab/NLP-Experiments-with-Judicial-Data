Appreciation of Evidence :

iS. From the discussion of the evidence On record it appears that the
PW1 is the father of the victim. According to him the victim had gone with the
accused and he lodged Complaint before police and accordingly both the accused
and his daughter surrendered before police. He also Stated that at the time of
occurrence his daughter was reading in class x. Further he Stated that his daughter
had failed in Class I and class IX. From his Cross examination PW1 stated that his
daughter's age May be 19 to 20 years, Victim was €xamined as Pw3. She stated
that she had eloped with the accused and they lived together as husband and wife,
In cross examination she stated that accused is related to her. She also Stated that
she failed in Class V and Class IX. So far other non-official witnesses are concerned
their evidence is here say,

 

14, I have also perused the Statement of victim u/s 164 Cr.PC wherein
she stated that she had voluntarily gone with the accused.

15, On Scrutiny of the evidence it appears that both PW1 and the victim
father and daughter respectively stated that the victim Was aged about 16 years
and she had failed in two Classes, Further from the evidence of MO it appears that
without any Ossification test the MO stated victim’s age to be 15 years 2 months,
Further it is in the Evidence of MO that there is no evidence Of sexual intercourse or
violent mark on the body or private part of the victim,

16. So Considering the Various Statements regarding age | am of the
opinion that the victim is not below 18 y€ars of age. On the other hand from the
Version of the victim it is quite clear that she had gone with the accused of her own
accord. |
