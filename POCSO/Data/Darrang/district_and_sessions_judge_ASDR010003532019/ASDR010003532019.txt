REASONS AND DECISION THEREON

In the course of trial, the prosecution examined PW1(informant) Junu

considered as Veterinary doctor by them in his chamber. After returning
Niharika reported her that the doctor hurled filthy words against her.
Thereafter, she filed a case. Ext.1 is her FIR and Ext.1(1) is her signature.

PW2 Niharika Boro has stated in her evidence that on the day of the
incident while she met the accused in his chamber the accused kissed her
and gave ten rupees to buy chocolate. In the course of investigation she
was produced before the Court for recording her statement. Ext.2 is her

statement and Ext.2(1) and 2(2) are her signatures.

PW3 Milon Boro was not aware about the incident that occured on the

date of the incident. So prosecution declared this witness as hostile.

The most crucial part of the evidence of the victim is her evidence
regarding the incident that occured in the Veterinary Hospital. In her
evidence made before this court she has stated that she was kissed by
the accused and paid Rs.10/- to buy chocolate for herself. This is the only
evidence against the accused in the evidence of PW2 Niharika Boro. But
in her statement recorded U/S 164 Cr.P.C. she has stated that the accused
outraged her modesty by touching her breast when she visited the
chamber of the accused to provide betel-nut. The informant(PW1) has
stated in her evidence that after returning from the chamber of the
accused she informed her that the accused had hurled filthy words
against her. Thus, the evidence brought against the accused are not
similar and both PW1 and PW2 gave a different versions. PW3 did not
Support the prosecution case. Thus, there is no evidence against the
accused person so far the alleged incident of outrage of modesty of PW2

Niharika Boro is concerned, the accused cannot be held guilty.

Thus, the accused Abab Deka is acquitted for lack of evidence and set at
liberty forthwith.

. The bail bond of the accused shall remain enforce for next six months U/S

437(A) CrP.C..
