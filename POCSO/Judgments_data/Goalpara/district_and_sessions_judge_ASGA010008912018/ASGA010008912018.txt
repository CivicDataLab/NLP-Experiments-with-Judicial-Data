4. | have heard submissions of both parties and also gone through
the evidence on record.

5. DISCUSSIONS, DECISIONS AND RESONS THREOF :

 

PW1 stated that he is the informant of the case and he does not
know the accused. The victim is his daughter. At the time of incident his
daughter was aged about 15 years. Six months earlier, at around 10:00 A.M,
the occurrence took place. At that time he was in the market and his wife
called him on the phone and asked him to come home. On his return, he saw
many persons have gathered at his house. On reaching the P.O. he came to
know that the villagers have apprehended the accused on suspicion. He was
caught as he was talking with his daughter. As per version of the public he
lodged the F.I.R.

6. PW2 is the prosecutrix who stated that the informant is her
father and he know the accused. One year back she went to the house of the
accused at 10:00 A.M and they were talking to each other. Her uncle saw her.
The matter was informed to her mother. For this incident, her father had
lodged the F.I.R. The accused had not done anything with her. Later on, she
gave statement in the Court. Ext.1 is the statement and Ext.1(1) is her

signature.

7. On examining the evidence of PW1, it transpires that at the
time of incident he was in the market and his wife called him back. On
reaching home, he saw a big crowd and as per version of the public, he
lodged the F.I.R. The allegation against the accused is that he had committed
penetrative sexual assault upon the prosecutrix. The informant in his
evidence remained silent regarding any sexual assault or harassment given
by the accused to the prosecutrix. Further, his evidence clearly shows that
he lodged the F.I.R. as he was told by public who apprehended the accused.
In a case of present nature, the evidence of the prosecutrix is very vital as
generally in such incident there may not be anyâ€™ eye witness. The
prosecutrix in her evidence only stated that she went to the house of the
accused as they were having conversation. Her uncle saw them and
accordingly, her father lodged the F.I.R. The prosecutrix in her evidence also
remained silent that the accused had done anything bad things with her. She
categorically in her evidence stated that accused had done any thing with
her. The witness proved her statement Ext.1 but in her cross-examination she
gave her statement as told by the public.

8. From the evidence of the informant and the prosecutrix, it
clearly transpires that the witnesses did not implicate the accused and there
is nothing to hold that the accused had done anything with the prosecutrix.
As the prime witness did not support the case and therefore, there is nothing
to hold that the accused had committed the offence for which he is facing
trial.

9. In the result, the prosecution has failed to prove the charge
against the accused and the accused deserves to be acquitted and

3
accordingly, he is acquitted.

10. The bail bond of the accused stands cancelled after six month
from the judgment.

Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 26% day of
April, 2019.
