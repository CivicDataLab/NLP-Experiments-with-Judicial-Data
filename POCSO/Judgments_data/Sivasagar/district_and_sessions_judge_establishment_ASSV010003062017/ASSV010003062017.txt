POINTS FOR DETERMINATION ARE -
8. (1) Whether on 02.09.2014, at about 10.00 AM accused kidnapped/
abducted the victim 'X'?

(11) If so, what was the intention of the accused behind such kidnap/
abduction?

(111) Whether on 02.09.2014 or thereafter, the victim 'X' was
Subjected to penetrative sexual assault by the accused?
DECI SION AND REASONS THEREOF

9. P.W. 1 Sri Rajesh Churi, the informant and the father of the
victim 'X' in his evidence deposed that about three years back, due to her love
affairs, victim flew away with the accused. On her missing, he lodged the FIR.
Exbt.1 is the said FIR. P.W. 1 further deposed that at the relevant time victim
was aged about 18 years. After their recovery, he learnt that his daughter on
her own will entered into marriage with the accused and presently they are
living peaceful conjugal life. One child was begotten to his daughter. In cross
by defence he stated that he is not willing to proceed further with this case by

adducing evidence and accused may kindly be acquitted.

10. P.W. 2 is the victim 'X' in her evidence deposed that about three
years back, having love affairs with the accused she flew away with him and
performed marriage and lived at Sivasagar for about 10 days. On her missing,
her father lodged the FIR. On Knowing about the case, they appeared at the
Namtola Police Station. Police got her medically examined. She was taken to
Court where she gave her statement vide Exbt. 2. At the relevant time, she
was aged about 18 years. Presently they are living peaceful conjugal life. One
child was begotten to her. In cross by defence she stated that she is not
willing to proceed further with this case by adducing evidence and accused
may kindly be acquitted.

11. From the evidence of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 it is seen that at the
relevant time victim was major in age. Victim has categorically admitted that

due to her affair, she eloped with the accused on her own, lived with the
Spl. (P) Case No.15/2017 Page 3 of 5
accused for ten days at Sivasagar and performed marriage with him. Presently
they are living peaceful conjugal life and in their wedlock, one child was born.
From her cross examination, it appears that she is not willing to proceed
further with this case and prayed for acquittal of the accused. P.W. 1 being the
father of the victim and informant has also stated that now he is not willing to
proceed further with this case by adducing more evidence. From the evidence
of P.W. 1 and P.W. 2 it appears that the ingredients of abduction or

penetrative sexual assault are missing.

12. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the charge U/S 366 IPC and Section 4 of POCSO Act, or any
other minor offences against the accused. As such, accused Dharmeswar
Bhuyan is acquitted from the charge U/S 366 IPC and Section 4 of POCSO Act,
2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

13. Bail bonds executed by the accused and his surety stand

extended for another six months from today.

14. Considering the fact and circumstances of the case, the matter is

not referred to DLSA for granting compensation U/S 357 A Cr.P.C.

15. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Charaideo at Sonari U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

16. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of

on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 20" day of June
