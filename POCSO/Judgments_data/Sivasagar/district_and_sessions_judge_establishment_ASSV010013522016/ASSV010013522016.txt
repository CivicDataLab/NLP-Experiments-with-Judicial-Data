JUDGMENT

1. Prosecution case in brief is that on 29.12.2016, informant Sri Smt.

Sonu Das lodged an FIR with O/C, Nazira Model Police Station alleging, inter
alia, that having love affairs with her daughter victim 'R' (name withheld), aged
about 16 years, accused Sri Bhadra Das frequently came to her house and
made cohabitation with the victim and caused her pregnant for six months. It is
also alleged that on knowing this incident from the victim, she asked the
accused to marry the victim, but even making promise, accused did not turn up.

On this, due to non-accepting the victim, the informant lodged the instant FIR.

POINT FOR DETERMINATION ARE -
5. (I) Whether prior to filing of FIR on 29.12.2016, victim 'R' was

subjected to aggravated penetrative sexual assault by the accused?
DECI SION AND REASONS THEREOF

6. PW-1 Smt. Sonu Das, the informant and mother of the victim in
her evidence deposed that on 29.12.2016, she lodged Exbt. 1 FIR due to not
accepting her daughter even making promise and keeping relation with her.
After 2 months of filling FIR, accused performed marriage with her daughter
(victim R) and presently they are living as wife and husband. Recently, victim
has delivered one male child. In her cross-examination, she admitted that due
to misunderstanding, she lodged the FIR. Presently they have settled the
dispute.

7. PW-2 Smt. Latika Das in her evidence deposed that during
investigation by police, she came to know that victim R was pregnant. She saw
the accused while coming to the house of victim. After filling of the case,
accused performed marriage with the victim and presently they are living as
wife and husband. In her cross-examination she admitted that she did not ask

the victim about the incident.

Spl. (P) Case No. 60/2016 Page 2 of 4
8. PW-3 victim R in her evidence deposed that accused Bhadra Das
is her husband. Her present age is about 20 years. Having love affairs with
accused, they made frequent cohabitation and she got pregnant through the
accused. While she was pregnant for five months, accused decline to marry her.
On this her mother filed this case. On filling this case, Police took her for
medical check up and also in court. She gave statement in court. Exbt. 2 is her
statement given in court. After filling of this case, before child birth, accused
agreed to take her as his wife and they started conjugal life by performing
social marriage. Presently she has no grievances against the accused. In her
cross-examination she admitted that accused did not cohabit with her by force.
Her mother filed this case due to misunderstanding. Presently she is living

peaceful conjugal life with the accused. She prayed for acquittal of the accused.

9. Basing at the above evidence on record, so far the offence of
penetrative sexual assault is concerned, from the evidence of PW 3 the victim,
it appears that she was presently aged as 20 years. She admitted of having
love affairs with the accused and of her physical relation with the accused on
her consent. From the evidence of victim and PW 1, it appears due to non-
accepting the victim while she was pregnant for five months, PW 1 lodged the
FIR. From their evidence it also reveals that after filing of the FIR, accused
performed marriage with the victim and presently they are living as wife and
husband and now they have no grievances against the accused. In cross
examination both PW 1 and PW 3 clearly stated that due to some
misunderstanding PW 1 has lodged the FIR. Presently they have settled the
dispute and prayed for acquittal of the accused from this case. In cross PW 3
categorically stated that accused did not cohabit with her by force. So from the
above facts on record, it appears that there was no material whatsoever

regarding penetrative sexual assault by the accused.

10. Considering all above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has
failed to prove the ingredients of charge U/S 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 against the

accused Sri Bhadra Das. As such, accused Sri Bhadra Das is acquitted from the

Spl. (P) Case No. 60/2016 Page 3 of 4
charges U/S 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

11. Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety are extended for
another six months from today U/S 437-A Cr.P.C.

12. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357-A Cr.P.C.

13. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

14. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of

on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 27" day of
October, 2018 Sivasagar.
