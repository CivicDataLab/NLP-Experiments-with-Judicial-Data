DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF :

7. P.W.1 the victim X, in her evidence deposed that in the month of
June 2014, while she was going to school accused Ismile teased her by saying

that on performance of marriage, children born and asked her to marry him.
Spl. (P) Case No. 19 of 2014 Page 2 of 6
She has objected the matter to his parents. On this incident, she lodged the
FIR (Exbt. 1) Galeky Police Station. Police got her medically examined. She
also gave her statement in Court vide Exhibit 2. In her cross-examination she
admitted that her residence is near to the accused. At the time of the incident
she was reading in class 10. She knew the accused 2 days prior of the incident.
While filing the FIR, her uncle has accompanied with her. She admitted that on
29.06.2014, one Hamidullah has lodged an FIR against her parents, Najir Ali,
Pori Begum, her brother Sajif Ali, herself and her uncle Bokli Ali for physically
assaulting Azima Begum. She has no knowledge if Sohura Begum has lodged
an FIR at Galaky Police Station of physically assaulting her mother. She denied
that on 28.06.2014, her brother Nasif Rahaman took the accused Ismile Ali to
his residence and his parents and his brother insulted Ismile Ali and Azima

Begum. She also denied that out of grudge, she has lodge the false FIR.

8. P.W. 2 Dr. Sadhan Bora, in his evidence deposed that on
28.07.2014, he has examined the victim X and found that the age of the victim
is above 16 years and below 18 years. He proved his report as Exhibit 3. In his
cross-examination, he admitted that no lady doctor was present at time of the

examination of the victim.

9. P.W. 3 Firuja Begum and P.W.4 Mofija Begum in their evidence

deposed that they have no knowledge about the incident.

10. PW. 5 the 1.0. Sri Ashim Borah, in his evidence deposed that on
30.06.2016, he received the FIR from victim X and during investigation, he
visited the place of occurrence and prepared the sketch map (Exhibit.4). He
recorded the statements of witnesses including the victim, got the victim
medically examine and got her statement U/S 164 Cr.P.C and on completion of
the investigation submitted charge sheet U/S 12 of POCSO Act against the
accused Ismile Ali and charge sheet U/S 17 of POCSO Act against the accused
Abdul Kasim and Azima Begum vide Exhibit 5. In his cross he admitted that
name of accused Ismile Ali was not mentioned in the FIR. During investigation

Spl. (P) Case No. 19 of 2014 Page 3 of 6
he has not collected any age prove documents of the victim. He has not
enquired about the Galaky P.S case No 51/2014 and 52/14.

11. So far Point No. |, from the evidence on record it appears that
though in the FIR specific allegation of instigating her to flee away has been
leveled against accused Moulona Kasim Ali and Mustt. Azima Begum, but
during evidence, as discussed above, the victim has kept mum against any
word of abetment against the accused Kasim Ali and Azima Begum. From
the examination-in-chief of the victim it appears that she has brought some
allegations against accused Ismile Ali only. No allegation of abating the

accused Ismile Ali in causing sexual harassment was deposed.

12. So far Point No. Il is concerned, the victim in her FIR did not
mention the name of the accused. In the FIR victim has alleged regarding
teasing her in indecent way. However from the examination-in-chief of the
victim it appears that she has specifically stated that accused Ismile teased her
by saying that on performance of marriage children born and asked her to
marry him. This part of the evidence of the victim gets no corroboration from
the evidence of P.W. 3 and P.W. 4. In her evidence she also deposed that she
had informed the matter to her parents but prosecution did not examine them
as witness to corroborate the fact. On going through the cross examination of
the victim it appears that she has specifically admitted that on the previous
day, i.e. on 29.06.2014 one Hamidullah lodged an FIR alleging physical assault
to Asfina Begum by her parents, brother and by implicating her and others.
From the evidence of M.O. (P.W.2) it appears that no mark of injury was
detected on her person. P.W.3 though a close relative of the informant/victim,
but she deposed that she has no knowledge of any such incident. The 1.0.
(P.W.5) in his cross examination admitted that he has not inquired regarding
Geleky P.S. Case No.51/2014 filed by Hamidullah and Geleky P.S. Case
No.52/2014 filed by one Sahera Begum.

13. From the above discussion, it appears that the evidence of the

Spl. (P) Case No. 19 of 2014 Page 4 of 6
victim regarding teasing her by the accused remains uncorroborated. The
allegation also becomes more doubtful in view of the fact that on the previous
day of the alleged occurrence, the wife of the accused Ismile has lodged an
FIR against the victim and her other family members and this fact shows

possibility of filling counter allegation in grudge.

14. In view of the above discussion, | am of the opinion that
prosecution has failed to bring home the charges against the accused persons
beyond all reasonable doubt. The prosecution case appears to be doubtful. As

such, | hold that all the three accused persons are entitled for benefit of doubt.

15. Considering all above, accused Md. Ismile Ali is acquitted from
the charge U/S 12 of POCSO Act, 2012 and accused Md. Abu Kasim Ali and
Mustt. Azima Begum are acquitted from the charge U/S 17 of POCSO Act,
2012 on benefit of doubt and set them at liberty forthwith.

16. The bail bonds executed by the accused persons and their
sureties stand extended for another six months from today.

17. Considering the nature of the case, | am of the opinion that it is
not a fit case for referring the matter to DLSA for granting compensation U/S
357-A Cr.P.C.

18. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar U/S 365 Cr.P.C.

19. Judgment is pronounced in open court. Case is disposed on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 5 day of April,
2017 at Sivasagar.
