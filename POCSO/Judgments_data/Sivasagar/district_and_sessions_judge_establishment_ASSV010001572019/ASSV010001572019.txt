1. Prosecution case in brief is that on 21.05.2018, informant Sri K.

Gohain lodged an FIR with O/C, Namti P.S. alleging, inter alia, that on that day,
at about 9 AM, while his daughter victim 'R' (name withheld) came out from
Namti Peoli Phukan College for returning home, she was forcibly taken by
accused Niranjan Bezbaruah from the road. It is also mentioned in the FIR that
his eldest daughter Smt. P Gohain got married with accused Niranjan

Bezbaruah, but she also came back to her paternal house as she was subjected

Spl. (P) Case No. 9/2019 Page 1 of 6
to mental and physical tortures on demand of dowry. It is also alleged that

nature of the accused is not good and he is a man of bad character.

2. On receipt of the FIR, Namti P.S. Case No. 11/2018 u/s 366 IPC
was registered and investigated. During investigation, victim was recovered.
She was medically examined and also recorded her statement in Court u/s 164

Cr.P.C. Accused was arrested and forwarded to Court for judicial custody.

3, On completion of investigation, 1.0. has submitted Charge-Sheet

Charge-Sheet, vide order dated 29.10.2018, learned Judicial Magistrate 1st
Class Nazira, by complying the provision of Section 209 Cr.P.C. has committed
the case for trial before this Court since the offence u/s 366 IPC is exclusively

triable by the Court of Sessions.

4. It may be noted here that initially the instant case was registered
as Sessions Case No. 135 (S-N) of 2018. However, after perusal of the
materials on record and during hearing on charge, there is sufficient material to
proceed under the provisions of POCSO Act, 2012. As the offences under
POCSO Act are exclusively triable by Special Judge, as such vide order dated
07.03.2019, the instant case was re-registered as Spl. (P) Case No. 09 of 2019.

considered the submission of both the sides.
7. POINTS FOR DETERMINATION ARE~ -

(i) Whether on 21.05.2018 accused kidnapped or abducted the
victim? If so, what was the intention of the accused behind such
Kidnap/ abduction?

(iil) | Whether accused being relative has committed rape on the victim?

(iii) Whether victim was subjected to aggravated penetrative sexual
assault or she was subjected to sexual assault by the accused?

DECI SION AND REASONS THEREOF :
8. PW 1 Sri Kumud Gohain, father of the victim, while claiming the
age of the victim as 19 years in his evidence deposed that on 21.05.2018, due
to non-return of victim from her college till evening hours, they searched her
and came to know that victim was taken by accused Niranjan Bezbaruah. On
this, on the next day he lodged the FIR vide Exbt. 1. Subsequently, after about
14 days, police apprehended the accused and recovered victim from Kakapathar
area under Tinsukia District. Police took the victim for medical checkup and also
brought her to Court. From Court victim was given in his custody. On asking
victim, she informed him that accused being her brother-in-law, took her with
him for visit. Presently victim was married to others boy and she was at her
matrimonial home. In cross examination, PW 1 admitted that he has lodged the
FIR on suspicion. Now he does not want to prosecute this case any further. He

has no objection in acquittal of the accused from this case.

9. PW 2 the victim in her evidence deposed that accused Niranjan
Bezbaruah is known to her being her brother-in-law. Presently she is aged
about 19 years. She read upto Class-XIIl. On 21.05.2018, at about 12 noon,
accused met her at her college and on his request, she went with him for social
visit without informing her parents. Accused took her with him to Tinsukia and
kept her at the house of his relative for about 14 days. Subsequently, police
came there and apprehended the accused and brought her therefrom. Police

took her for medical checkup and also in Court. She gave her statement in

Spl. (P) Case No. 9/2019 Page 3 of 6
Court vide Exbt. 2. From Court, she went with her parents and informed about
the fact of this case. Presently she was married to S. Lahon and living conjugal
life with him. In her cross-examination the victim has admitted that she went
with the accused on her own. Accused did not put force on her for going with

him. She has no objection in acquittal of the accused from this case.

10. From the above evidence on record, so far age of the victim is
concerned, it appeared that on the date of evidence she claimed her age as 19
years. Incident is of about 10 months back. Thus it appears that she was major
on the date of incident. During investigation she was medically examined at
Sivasagar Civil Hospital and in the medical examination report, which was made
part of charge sheet, her age was mentioned as above 18 years. No other
evidence was brought on record on age of the victim. It can safely be held that

on the date of alleged incident, the victim was aged above 18 years of age.

11. Now coming on the charge of abduction and rape, from the
evidence of PW 2, the victim, it appears that on the day of occurrence, I.e. on
21.05.2018, on request of the accused, she went to Tinsukia with the accused
for social visit without informing her parents. From her cross-examination, it
also reveals that she went with the accused on her own and accused did not
use force on her for going with him. PW 1 being father of the victim simply
deposed that due to non-finding of victim till evening of 21.05.2018, on the
next day he lodged the FIR. Subsequently, police recovered the victim and on
asking the victim, she informed him that accused being her brother-in-law took
her with him for visit. In his cross examination PW 1 admitted that he lodged
the FIR on suspicion. So from the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2, it appears that
none of them deposed anything against the accused involving him with the

alleged offence of kidnap/abduction.

12. So far charge of penetrative sexual assault/rape is concerned,
from the evidence of PW 2 the victim, it appears that while giving statement in

court she has not stated anything against the accused for making sexual assault

Spl. (P) Case No. 9/2019 Page 4 of 6
on her. In her evidence the victim nowhere stated that during her stay at the
house of relative at Tinsukia for about 14 days, accused has committed rape or
She was subjected to penetrative sexual intercourse by the accused with or
without consent. However in her 164 Cr.P.C she has stated about physical
relation by claiming her age as 17 years and on that basis charge under Pocso
Act was framed but as she the victim did not corroborated the same during
trial, that part of statement cannot be accepted as admissible evidence. Most
probably considering his relation with accused and the fact that she was
married with other boy, she has suppressed the entire fact during evidence or
under some pressure she had exaggerated the facts in her 164 Cr. PC
statement. So from the evidence of victim, it is seen that there is no evidence

of rape/penetrative sexual assault on the victim by the accused.

13. Considering above, | am of the opinion that prosecution has

failed to prove the ingredients of charge u/s 366, 376(2)(f) IPC and Section 6

of POCSO Act 2012 against the accused Sri Niranjan Bezbaruah. As such, the

accused Niranjan Bezbaruah is acquitted from the charge u/s 4 366, 376(2)(f)

IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

14. Bail bond executed by the accused and his surety is extended for
another six months from today u/s 437-A CrP.C.

15. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to

DLSA for granting compensation u/s 357 (A) CrP.C.

16. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate,
Sivasagar u/s 365 CrP.C.

17. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of
on contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 2 day of April,
2019 at Sivasagar.
