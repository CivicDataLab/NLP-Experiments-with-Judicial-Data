Decision, Discussion and reasons :

 

10) The P.W.1 is the mother of the victim. She stated that on 08.03.2017 her
daughter was a student of class V and she was aged about 10 years. On 08.03.2017 at
about 8.30 a.m. Mamoni Hazarika sent her minor daughter/victim to bring milk. After
sometimes her daughter returned weeping without bringing milk and informed her aunt
Mamoni Hazarika that while she went to the house of the accused, the accused called
her inside and grabbed her from the back side. The accused than kissed her cheek,
touched her breast and body. She also told that the accused asked her as to whether she
likes him or not. Then the victim ran way from the place. The PW-1 stated that Mamoni
Hazarika informed her about the entire incident and then she asked her daughter about
the incident and she also narrated in the similar manner. Then the PW-1 along with her
daughter and neighbours went to the house of the accused but he was not found. After
sometimes Hemi Das informed that the accused was hiding himself under the bed in the
house of his son Nayan Kakoty. Then the accused was pulled out from the place. After
sometimes her daughter went to the police station and lodged the FIR. Her daughter was

medically examined and her statement was also recorded in the Court.

In cross-examination PW-1 admitted that she did not state before the |.0. that
the accused had grabbed her daughter, that she enquired about the matter from her
daughter and took her to the house of the accused after the incident. The PW-1 further
stated that they used to purchase goods on credit from the shop of the accused. The
PW-1 denied that while taking milk her daughter had stolen money from the house of
the accused and seeing this the accused slapped her daughter and in the process the
milk cane fell down. The PW-1 denied that as the accused had rebuked her daughter

they concocted a false story and lodged a false FIR against the accused.

11) The P.W.2 is the minor victim. Before recording her evidence this Court tested

her capacity and reasonableness to understand the questions put to her and on being

2
Spl. (P) Case No. 11/2017
Date : 28.05.2019

satisfied recorded the evidence. The PW-2 stated that the accused is her related grand-
father. On -08.03.2017 at around 8.00 a.m. (wrongly written as 8.00 p.m.)she went to
the house of the accused to bring milk. Accidentally milk spilled from her hand and for
that reason the accused scolded her and also assaulted her. Then she came back home
and informed her mother about the incident. The family members of the accused were
not at home at the relevant time. The PW-2 stated that she lodged FIR as asked by her
family members which is marked as Ext. lwherein Ext.1(1) is her signature. She stated
that she was medically examined. Her statement was recorded in the Court. Which is

marked as Ext. 2 wherein Ext.2(1) is her signature.

In cross-examination PW-2 stated that the accused did not touch her
inappropriately. She stated that as she spilled milk, the accused assaulted her. She also
stated that the FIR was written by some other person and she did not know the
contents of the FIR. She also stated that she had a cordial relationship of the accused
and visit the house of the accused. She also stated that the accused had lodged a case

against them which he has withdrawn.

12) The P.W.3 Barnali Das, PW-4 Hemi Das, PW-5 Mamoni Hazarika and PW-6 Axomi
Hazarika are the independent witness. The PW-3 stated that she heard that a quarrel
took place in between the victim and the family members of the accused. The PW-4
stated that she heard that a quarrel took place in between the accused and the victim.
She also heard that the mother of the victim informed the public that the accused had
committed misdeed with her minor daughter. The PW-5 in her evidence stated that the
victim had informed her that the accused assaulted her physically and accordingly she
informed the matter to her mother. The PW-6 stated in her evidence that after arriving
home she came to know from Mamoni that the accused had assaulted the victim.

From the evidence of the independent witnesses it is clear that they do not have

any personal knowledge about the incident.

13) = The PW-7 is Retd. SI namely Bokul Bora who in his evidence stated that on
08.03.2017 he was posted at Sivasagar police station. On that day on the basis of the
FIR lodged by the informant/victim Sivasagar PS case no. 160/17 u/s. 8 of POCSO Act
was registered. During investigation he recorded the statement of the witnesses, visited
the place of occurrence, prepared the sketch map, examined the victim medically and

also got her statement recorded u/s. 164 of Cr.P.C. The accused was arrested and

3
Spl. (P) Case No. 11/2017
Date : 28.05.2019

forwarded to the Court. On completion of the investigation and upon finding
incriminating materials against the accused Sushil kakoty, he submitted charge-sheet
against him u/s. 8 of POCSO Act. The PW-7 exhibited the sketch map which is marked
as Ext. 3 wherein Ext.3(1) is his signature. He also exhibited the medical report
collected by him which is marked as Ext.4. The PW-7 exhibited the charge-sheet marked

as Ext. 5 wherein Ext.5(1) is his signature.

In cross-examination the PW-7 denied that he did not record the statement of
the victim girl as per section 24 of the POCSO Act. He also admitted that he did not
collect the birth certificate from the school of the victim regarding his age or date of
birth.

14) In her statement recorded u/s. 1640f Cr.P.C. which is marked as Exdt.2 the
victim stated that on 08.03.2017 at around 8.00 a.m. as per her daily routine she went
to the house of the accused Sushil Kakoty to fetch milk. The accused called her inside
the house and caught hold of her hands and touched her inappropriately on her chest.
Thereafter he pulled her cheek and kissed her. She somehow managed to escape from
the place of occurrence. She stated that after returning she narrated the entire incident

to at Mamoni Hazarika.

15) Section 10 of the POCSO Act,2012 provides for punishment for aggravated
sexual assault. Section 9 of the POPCSO Act describes aggravated sexual assault.
According to section 9(m) a person is said to commit aggravated sexual assault if he

commits sexual assault on a child below 12 years of age.

16) From perusal of the materials available on record it appears that the victim of
this case was aged about 11 years. In his examination u/s. 313 of Cr.P.C. the accused
also admitted that on 08.03.2017 the victim was a student of class V and she was aged
about 10 years. Therefore, so far as the age is concerned, there is no dispute that at

the time of the alleged occurrence she was below 12 years of age.

17) |The next point to be decided is whether the accused sexually assaulted the
victim. In the course of trial the prosecution side exhibited FIR marked as Ext. 1
wherein the informant/victim narrated that she was sexually assaulted by the accused
on 08.03.2017 at about 8.00 a.m. when she went to the house of the accused to bring

4
Spl. (P) Case No. 11/2017
Date : 28.05.2019

milk taking advantage of absence of the other family members in the house of the
accused. But in her evidence the PW-2 who is the informant-cum-victim stated that she
lodged ejahar (Ext.1) as asked by her family members to do so. In her cross-
examination she admitted that she did not write the ejahar and she was not aware of its

contents.

18) The prosecution side exhibited the statement recorded u/s. 164 of Cr.P.C. of the
victim girl marked as Ext. 2 wherein she narrated the alleged incident before the Id.

J MFC, Sivasagar.

19) From perusal of the Ext. 2 it appears that she was administered oath before
making her statement. From perusal of the order dated 08.03.2017 passed by the ld.
JMFC, Sivasagar after recording the statement of the said victim wherein it was
mentioned that the victim was given sufficient time for reflection. The case record
reveals that the victim was produced on 08.03.2017. This is relevant in this case in view
of the fact that the said victim while adducing her evidence as PW-2 narrated a totally
different story in the Court. The PW-2 victim stated in her evidence that on 08.03.2017
she went to the house of the accused at around 8.00 a.m. (wrongly written as 8.00
p.m.) to bring milk and at that time accidentally the glass of milk fell down from her
hand that for reason the accused scolded her and also assaulted her. She came back
home and told the incident to her mother. In her cross-examination she clearly stated
that the accused did not touch her inappropriately. She further stated that as she spilled
the milk, the accused assaulted her. She further stated that she has good relation with
the accused.

20) From the evidence of the PW-2/victim it is clear that no such incident took place
as alleged in the FIR. She also stated that she lodged the FIR which was written by
some other person under instruction of her family members and she did not know the
contents of the said FIR. On the other hand PW-1 who is the mother of the victim
stated that at about 8.30 a.m. on 08.03.2017 her daughter returned back weeping and
without bringing milk and on being asked she informed her aunt Mamoni Hazarika that
the accused called her inside the house and kissed her cheek and also touched her
breast and body. She also told that the accused asked her as to whether she likes him
or not. The PW-5 Mamoni Hazarika on the other hand stated that on the date of
occurrence the victim girl had gone to bring milk from the house to the accused and
after returning she informed that the accused assaulted her physically and accordingly

5
Spl. (P) Case No. 11/2017
Date : 28.05.2019

she informed the matter to her mother. Therefore, from the evidence of the PW-2 and
PW-5 it is clear that the PW-1 in fact tried to make out a case of sexual assault against
the accused and that is why the PW-2/victim stated that the ejahar was lodged on being

asked by her family members.

21) — From the discussion made above, it is clear that no such incident as alleged in
the ejahar took place. It is also pertinent to mention here that the other prosecution
witnesses had no personal knowledge about the incident and they heard about the

quarrel in between the victim and the family members of the accused.

22) — In view of the above the accused is held not guilty as the prosecution side has
miserably failed to establish the case against the accused. The accused is acquitted and
set at liberty forthwith.

(23) The bail bond of the accused is extended for a period of 6(six) months from

today.

Given under my hand and seal of this court on this 28" day of May, 2019.
