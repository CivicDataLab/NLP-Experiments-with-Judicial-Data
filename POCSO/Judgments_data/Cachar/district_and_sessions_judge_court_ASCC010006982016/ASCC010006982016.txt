JUDGMENT

1. Prosecution case in brief is that on 30/10/15 at about 5-30
p.m. in the absence of the complainant in the house his minor daughter
sherein below referred as victim, when went out in response of her
nature’s call, the accused forcibly dragging her mouth took her to the
nearby jungle and committed rape on her. On the following morning,
the victim was recovered from the house of the accused. Accordingly
FIR was lodged showing cause of delay. FIR was registered as Silchar
PS case no. 3010/15 u/s365/376 IPC.

2. During the investigation the victim was medically examined.
Doctor opined her age as above 14 and below 16. She also gave

statement before the Magistrate u/s. 164 Cr. P. C.

3. On completion of investigation I/O (Investigating Officer)
submitted charge-sheet against the accused u/s. 366/342/506 IPC r/w
section 4 of POCSO Act. On production of the accused the Id. Judicial
Magistrate Ist class after furnishing copies of all relevant police papers
as referred u/s. 173(2) Cr.P.C. committed the offence. This Court after
hearing both sides and perusing materials on the record framed formal
charge against the accused u/s. 366/342 IPC and also u/s 4 of POCSO
Ac. The charges were read over and explained to which the accused

pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Hence, trial began.

4. To prove the case prosecution altogether examined
8(eight)) witnesses as PW including the doctor, and I/O. Defence plea
appears to be as denial. Accused has been examined U/S 313 Cr.P.C.

and he pleaded innocence.

5. Now, the point for determination is whether the accused
kidnapped and wrongfully confined the victim? And, also committed

the offence of penetrative sexual assault ?

6. To decide above point I have heard Id. counsel of both

sides at length and perused the evidence on the record.

DISCUSSION, DECISIONS & REASONS THEREOF:

 

7. PW-1 are PW-2 are the father and mother of the victim who
is examined as PW-3. They in their examination in chief implicated
the accused persons giving corroborative accounts of the alleged
happenings as narrated in the FIR. However, in the cross examination
they completely deviated from their earlier stand. PW-1 in his cross
examination stated that out of misunderstanding he filed the case and
the victim at the material time was a major. He further stated that he
did not see the occurrence and he had no grievance against the accused.
PW-1 and 2 deposed as a reported witness being reported by their
victim daughter PW-3. The PW-3 in her examination in chief though
stated against the accused but in her cross examination she stated that
her mother settled her marriage without her consent with one Tajim and
for that out of anger she went to the house of her cousin namely Rabia
Begam on the date of the alleged incident. Rabia Begam is the wife of
the present accused. She further categorically stated that she voluntarily
went there and the accused did not commit rape on her and her mother

out of misunderstanding lodged the FIR.

8. PW-4 Mokbul Ali deposed that on query the victim reported

that she at her own will went to the house of the accused to avoid her
Page 4 of 6

marriage with another person. He was declared hostile by the

prosecution.

9. PW-5 and 6 also deposed accordingly. PW-7 is the IO and
PW-8 is the MO.

10. As the evidence of the material witnesses has been
completely rebutted in their cross examination discussion of the
evidence of JO and MO is felt not necessary. Similarly, their

trustworthiness is also eroded.

11. In view of the above discussions it can rightly be held that
prosecution case is not proved beyond all reasonable doubts. The
accused is thus held to be not guilty of the offence as charged or

whatsoever. He is thus acquitted and set at liberty forthwith.

12. Bail bond stands discharged.
