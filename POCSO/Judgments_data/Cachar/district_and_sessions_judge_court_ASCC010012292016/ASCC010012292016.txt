Spl POCSO 25/16.
03-12-16:

Accused is present. Three P.Ws including the
victim and the complainant are present. Their evidence are
recorded and they are discharged. The victim is examined in
camera and she could identify the accused as their closed
door neighbour. From the nature of evidence of five numbers
of witnesses so far recorded learned P.P. has submitted for
closure of prosecution evidence. Perused the record. I find
substance in the submission. Hence evidence is closed. I
would like to dispose of the case U/S 232 Cr.P.C. Accused is
examined. Heard argument of both sides.

In the instance case charge was framed U/S 12 of
POCSO Act with accusation that on 06-02-14 at 8-30 a.m.
the victim daughter of the complainant was _ sexually
assaulted by the accused. To prove the case prosecution
examined five witnesses. Of them P.W.3 is the complainant
who deposed that out of misunderstanding she lodged the
FIR Ext-1. Her version is that at the time of alleged incident
the victim went to the grocery shop of the accused who
drove out the victim from his shop and for that there was an
altercation and out of anger she lodged the case. P.W.5 the
victim of this case aged about ten years and a student of class
IV. She deposed that on her request to provide a blade the
accused drove her out from the shop. Nothing more was
happened.

From the evidence of P.W.1,2 and 4 no materials come
out against the accused.

From the above it can rightly be arrived at the charge
so framed is not proved for want of any incriminating
materials about any alleged sexual assault. The accused thus
held to be not guilty of the charge so framed or whatsoever.
Accused is acquitted and set at liberty forthwith.

Bail bond stands discharged.

This order of acquittal is pronounced and delivered in
the open Court under my seal & signature of this Court on
this 3 day of December,2016.

Special Judge.
Cachar, Silchar.
