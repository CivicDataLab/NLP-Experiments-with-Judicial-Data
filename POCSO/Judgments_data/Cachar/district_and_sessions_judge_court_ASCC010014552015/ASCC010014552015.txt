Order or other Proceeding

Accused persons are present.

The complainant and his victim
daughter are present as PW.
They are examined cross
examined and _ discharged.
( victim is examined in camera)
Considering the nature of
evidence Id. PP submitted for
closure of the prosecution
evidence mainly on the ground
that the instant case victim was
not medically examined during
investigation for ascertainment
of age.

Considering the nature of
evidence I find substance in the
submission. Prayer is therefore
allowed. I would like to proceed
to dispose of the case u/s 232
Cr.P.C.

Accused is examined. Heard

Office action

argument from both sides.

In the instant case charge was
framed on the accusation that
on 31/07/15 at about 12 O’clock
noon accused persons in
furtherance of their common
intention kidnapped the victim,
daughter of the complainant
from her house. In support of
the charge the complainant has
adduced evidence deposing that
on the date of occurrence on his
return from work he found his
daughter was missing in the
house he came to know from the
villagers that both the accused
persons took the victim by an
Auto and accordingly he lodged
ejhar. Police during investigation
recovered the victim from one
house at Algapur. Ext 1 is the
ejhar. It is seen that the house
of the accused persons is situated
in the village of the complainant.
He further deposed that on
being asked the victim stated
that she was taken by the
accused.

PW.2 is the victim . She had
deposed her age as 19.
According to her on the date of
occurrence she went to house of
one of her relative at Algapur
and finding her missing in the
house her father lodged ejhar.
She was recovered by the police.
She gave statement before the
Magistrate on being tutored by
others.

In the cross examination she
stated that accused did not
commit anything wrong against
her and_ she had no grievance
against the accused . She passed
class IX about 2/3 years ago.

Evidence of PW.1 being not
supported by the PW.2 with
regard to alleged taking away by
the accused is considered as
hearsay evidence.

The victim denied her age as 14
years. As the victim has not
adduced anything against the
accused and evidence of PW.1
being hearsay in nature as stated
earlier, virtually there is no
evidence against the accused
persons. Therefore, it is held that
prosecution case is _ not
established or proved against
the accused persons for want of
evidence.

Accused persons are thus held to
be not guilty of the offences as
charged or whatsoever. They are
thus acquitted and set at liberty
forthwith. Bail bonds stand
cancelled.

This order of acquittal is
pronounced and delivered in the
open court.

set fire on her who raised alarm
after that accused persons tried
to extinguish the fire putting
blanket on her and she was taken
