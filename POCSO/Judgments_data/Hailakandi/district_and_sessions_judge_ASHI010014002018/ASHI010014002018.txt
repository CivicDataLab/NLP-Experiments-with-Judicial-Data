POINTS FOR DETERMINATION :-

(1) Whether the accused person on 03.04.2015 at
about 1 PM at village Mohanpur Pt. V under Algapur PS kidnapped
the victim Shantana Rani Das, the minor daughter of the informant
to to with him or another person with intent that she may be or
knowing that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, as
alleged?

DISCUSSION, REASONS AND DECISION THEREOF :-

8. The PW. 1, the victim has deposed that she had
love affair with the accused and out of that, she eloped with the
accused on her own will and thereafter, she got married the
accused and has been living with him. Her father filed the case as

af
he was not agreed upon her marriage with the accused. It is further

deposed by the victim that police got her medically examined and
she also made statement before Magistrate vide Ext. 1, wherein Ext.
1(1) is her signature. At present, she is the mother of a child, out of
the wedlock with the accused and at the time of incident, she was
aged 18 years.

9. The PW. 2, Sri Badal Das, the informant, has
deposed that about 2 years back one day in the morning, his
daughter i.e. the victim went to school alongwith his another
daughter Suparna but after sometime, Suparna returned home and
reported that the accused kidnapped the victim and accordingly, he
lodged the FIR vide Ext. 2, wherein Exts. 2(1),2(2) and 2(3) are her
signatures. After 15/20 days, police recovered the victim and he
took zimma of the victim from the court but after 15 days of taking
zimma of the victim, the accused again kidnapped her and
thereafter, he did not file any case.

In cross examination, the informant has stated
that earlier, he deposed in this court in connection with the same
matter in Sessions Case No. 76/2017. It is further stated by the
witness that he can not say whether the victim on her own will
eloped with the accused or not.

10. In the instant case, the prime witness is the victim
and her evidence bears much significance to prove the alleged
commission of the offence by the accused. The victim in her
evidence has unequivocally divulged that at the relevant time, she
went with the accused on her own will, out of love affair and
thereafter, she married the accused and has been living with him as

COME, ..6si: P/5.

husband and wife and out of their wedlock, they have been blessed
with a child and at the relevant time of incident, she was 18 years
old. It has also been made clear by the victim that as her father was
not agreed upon her marriage with the accused, he lodged the case.
Though the informant i.e. the father of the victim has implicated the
accused person with the commission of the crime, alleged but it has
come out from his evidence that from the court, he took zimma of
the victim and took her to his house but subsequently, again the
accused took her and thereafter, the informant did not maintain any
relationship with the victim.

11. When the victim has not implicated the accused
person in her evidence with the commission of the alleged crime
and since the victim being major went with the accused at the
relevant time and is presently leading her conjugal life with the
accused happily as his wife having a child, | do not find it
appropriate to entangle the accused person with the guilt of
commission of the crime alleged.

Le. Accordingly, the accused person Alim Uddin
Mia @ Monua Mia_ is acquitted of the offence under Sec.
366(A)/376, IPC read with Sec. 4 of the POCSO Act. Set him
at liberty forthwith.

13. The bail bond of the accused person stands
discharged.

14, Send a copy of this judgment to the District
Magistrate, Hailakandi.

EH The Special (POCSO) case is disposed of
accordingly.
