Heard learned lawyers of the both sides as well as case diary. Perused the case record. Considering all aspects I find that the accused Shri Ram Yadav has committed the offences under sections 8/4/6 of the POCSO Act and accordingly charges are framed. The particular of the offences charged are duly read over and explained to the accused person to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. CWC is asked to submit report on the next date as to where at present the victims are staying.          Seen the bail petition filed by one Smti Sarita Devi praying for allowing the accused Shri Ram Yadav who has been in the jail hazot since 25.08.2019 in connection with this case to go on bail on the ground stated in the petition supported by an affidavit. Heard learned lawyers of the both sides. Perused the case record.           It has been submitted by the learned lawyer appearing on behalf of the accused person that as charge sheet has been submitted further detention of the accused person is not necessary at all. He has further submitted that for the fair trial accused needs to be out of the bar. It is a case wherein accused has been alleged of committing of aggravated penetrative and penetrative sexual assault upon his own daughters. In my considered opinion if accused is allowed to go on bail entire prosecution case will be frustrated. Hence the bail prayer is rejected.
