JUDGMENT

1). The prosecution case, in brief, is that on 29/04/2018, informant Sri
Ratul Hazarika, lodged a written ejahar with Jorhat Police Station, thereby stating
inter-alia, that since many days, his daughter [hereinafter referred as (X) in order
to screen her identity], by maintaining love relation with accused Sri Ashim
Dutta, has been indulged in immoral acts. People of the locality have raised
objection against such immoral acts and also torturing them for such acts. It
needs to be noted that in the ejahar [Exhibit-1], both accused Sri Ashim Dutta

and the victim [X], have been named as accused.

2). On receipt of the aforesaid F.I.R. by the Officer-in-charge, Jorhat P.S.,
the same was registered as Jorhat P.S. Case No. 949/2018 under Section 4 of
The Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The Officer-in-
charge, Jorhat P.S. entrusted S.I. Smt. Arpana Baruah to take up investigation of

the case.

2 (1) During the course of investigation, the I.0. visited the place of
occurrence, prepared Sketch Map of the same, recorded statements of the
witnesses and forwarded the accused Sri Ashim Dutta after arresting him. She
also got the statements of the victim recorded in the Court under Section 164 of
Cr.P.C. Then on completion of investigation, the I.0. laid charge-sheet against
accused Sri Ashim Dutta to stand trial in the Court under Section 4 of The
Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012 [in short, POCSO Act,
2012].

3). On production of the accused person before this Court, my learned
predecessor-in-court, after furnishing the copies of relevant documents and upon
hearing the learned counsel for both sides on the point of consideration of
charge and perusing the relevant materials, finding a prima-facie case under
Section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012, framed formal charge there under against the

SPECIAL CASE NO. 35 OF 2018
accused person. Particulars of accusations of above charge on being read over

and explained to the accused, he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.

4). To bring home the charge, the prosecution examined as many as 06
[six] witnesses including the victim, her parents including her father who is the
informant of the case. Further, the prosecution side exhibited the statement of
the victim [X] recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. as Exhibit-1, the ejahar as
Exhibit-2, the statement of the informant Sri Ratul Hazarika recorded under
Section 164 of Cr.P.C. as Exhibit-3, seizure-list as Exhibit-4 and Zimmanama as
Exhibit-5.

5). On closure of the prosecution evidence, statement of the above
named accused was recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. No defence evidence

was led in the instant case.

6). I have heard arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both
sides. I have also scrutinized the entire evidence of witnesses as well as all

relevant materials, including the exhibits on record.

7). POINT FOR DETERMINATION:-

Whether the accused person on or about several days
prior to the filing of the ejahar on 29/04/2018, at Chakihat, under
Jorhat P.S., committed penetrative sexual assault upon the daughter of

the informant, i.e., victim [X]?

DISCUSSION, DECISIONS AND REASONS THEREOF:

8). PW-1/victim ‘X’ deposed that on the day of the incident she had an
altercation with her mother over food. That her father became angry on her, and
thereafter, in a fit of rage, she called the accused person over phone, on which
her father became more angry. That then some women came to their house and

took away two mobile phones from her hand and also took her out of her house.

SPECIAL CASE NO. 35 OF 2018
That she stayed outside her house for more than an hour and after that went
inside. That her mother, on pretext of going to the house of the accused person,
took her to the police station where she found the women, who had come to her

house.

8 (i). During cross-examination, PW-1 stated that her family and the
family members of the accused person have good relation. That both families
knew that they loved each other. That a discussion has been going on between
the families for their marriage. In answer to the court, PW-1 stated that they did

not have physical relation and the accused person, did not touch her body.

9). PW-2/Smt. Niru Hazarika is the mother of victim/PW-1. She
deposed that victim had some altercation with the accused person over
telephone and she tried to make her understand. That the victim became angry

because of which, her husband also became angry.

10). PW-3/Sri Ratul Hazarika is the informant and father of the
victim/PW-1. He deposed that he had been told by the neighbours that accused
person indulged in sexual activities with his daughter/PW-1 as they had love

affairs.

10 (i). During cross-examination, PW-3 stated that the victim did not tell him
that the accused person had physical relation with her. That they are having

cordial relations presently and he had lodged the case as told by others.
11). PW-4/Sri Babul Hazarika deposed that he came to know that the
accused person and the victim/PW-1 had love affairs. That he did not ask the

victim about the incident.

12). PW-5/Smt. Aruna Dutta and PW-6/Smt. Mira Baruah deposed

that they knew that the accused person was having love affairs with the

SPECIAL CASE NO. 35 OF 2018
victim/PW-1. That they are not aware why the case has been lodged against the

accused person.

13). The evidence on record as discussed aforesaid, failed to make out
any case against the accused person. The victim/PW-1, who is on the verge of
attaining majority, also did not implicate the accused Sri Ashim Dutta.

Accordingly, he is entitled to acquittal and be set at liberty.

14). Accused is on bail. The bail bond of accused is extended for another

06 [six] months from today as per provision of Section 437-A Cr.P.C.

15). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 11th day of
