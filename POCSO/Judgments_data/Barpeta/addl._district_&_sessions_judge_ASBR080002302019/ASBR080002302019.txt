copies of the prosecution documents were furnished to him and after
hearing the learned Addl. P. P. appearing for the State and the learned

u/s 173 Cr.P.C., having been found sufficient grounds for presuming
that the accused person has committed the offence, framed the formal
charge 366 IPC and section 8 of POCSO Act, 2012. The charges so
framed was read over and explained to the accused person, to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Hence, the trial.

EVIDENCE OF THE WITNESSES

10. To arrive at the judicial decision, let me see what the
witnesses have stated.

11. PW-1 Sri Charayan Boro, deposed that he knows the
informant of this case and also knows the accused person Mutaleb Ali,

in the evening time he returned to home. After returning to home his
wife told him about the incident that the accused person took their
daughter on his lap and thereafter asked what and which class she was
reading. The accused person doing bamboo works with 'dao' for that
he went to their house for asking 'dao' to his wife. It is also told to him
by his wife that the accused person did not do anything to his
daughter.

During cross-examination, PW-1 deposed that the bamboo
bush was standing near to their house. The accused person with a
view to cut bamboo came to their house. Nothing had happened as
stated in the FIR.

12. PW-2 Smti. Rupay Boro, deposed that she knows the

Page No. 3 of 8

but do not know what he is doing. Victim is her daughter. She has
forgotten the date & day of occurrence. On that day the accused
person took her daughter to nearby bamboo bush and while she asked
why he took her daughter, then he released her daughter from his lap.
At that time some other persons were also there. Seeing the incident
the other persons who were present there insisted upon to file FIR. In
the mean time some boys of student union arrived and they have filed
the FIR. At that time her daughter was about 8 years old and was
reading in class Ill.

In cross-examination, PW-2 deposed that the bamboo
bush is standing near to their house. The accused person did not do
any misbehave or bad work to her daughter except taking her in his
lap due to affection. Nothing had happened as stated in the FIR.

13. PW-3 X(victim), deposed that one student of ABSU filed
this case. She does not know the accused person properly. Nothing
had happened with her. The accused person did not do anything with
her. Before today also one day she came to the Court but she has
forgotten what she stated in the Court on that day. One day the
accused person took her to nearby bamboo bush. Police one day took
her to FAAMCH, Barpeta for medical examination. The Doctor of
FAAMCH examined her by opening her mouth and eye and thereafter
produced her before the Court and whereby the Magistrate had
recorded her statement vide exhibit No. 1.

During her cross-examination, PW-3 deposed that the
accused person (i.e. the old man) did not do anything with her. ABSU
themselves filed this case.

14. PW-4 Sri Niran Ramchiary, deposed that at the time of
filing of the FIR he was the president of Duramari Unit A.B.S.U. He
knows the victim of this case, whose house is situated at Holongbari
(border of their village). He does not know the accused person. He has
seen the accused person only on today, but he knew that he is from
Holongbari. Before one year ago the incident took place. One day at
about 5.30 p.m. he came to know about the incident from some

Page No. 4 of 8
Spl. POCSO Case No. 11 of 2019

members of A.B.S.U. that the accused person asked 'dao' for cutting
bamboo from the mother of the victim. Accordingly the victim handed
over the 'dao' to that person. More than that he does not know
anything about it yet as per instruction of the villagers he lodged the
FIR. Vide exhibit No. 2.

During his cross-examination, deposed that he does not
know actually what had happened as he has not seen the incident.
But lodged the FIR after hearing about it from the villagers.

DISCUSSIONS, DECISIONS, AND REASONS THEREOF

 

15. Perused the case record and also gone through the
provision of law.

16. PW-4 in the informant who specifically stated before the
Court he do not know anything about the incident except that the
accused person came to the house of the victim and asked the
victim's mother about a 'dao' for cutting bamboo and following this
incident there was some gathering of villagers at the house of PW-1
and at the instigation of the villagers he had filed the FIR but he do
not know what actually had happened.

17. PW-2 is the father of the victim who at the time of the
happening of the incident was not present at the house and on
returning to home his wife (PW-1) told him that accused to their
house for asking a 'dao' to cutting bamboo except that PW-1 did not
tell him anything. It is also stated by him that nothing had happened
as stated in the FIR.

18. PW-3 the victim stated that the accused person did not
do any bad work with her but one day he took her in his lap near the
bamboo bush except that nothing had happened. PW-1 also deposed
that one day the accused person came to their house for asking a
â€˜'dao' with a view to cutting bamboo so following his request she
asked her daughter to give the 'dao' to the accused person and
accordingly her daughter (PW3) gave the 'dao' to the accused person.
She also stated that nothing had happed as stated in the FIR. The
villagers with the help of A.B.S.U. Students unnecessarily raised

Page No. 5 of 8
Spl. POCSO Case No. 11 of 2019
commotion and filed the FIR.

19. On considering the evidence of the witnesses it is found
that nothing had happened as stated in the FIR even PW-3 the victim
has also not supported to the case of the prosecution by saying that
the accused person did not do any bad work with her. The other
witnesses i.e. PW-2 & PW-4 are hearsay witnesses so their evidences
cannot be admissible under the law as they had heard about the
incident some third party but not from the victim. PW1 though
present at the time of happening of the incident but did not implicate

the accused person in any manner.

20. Court cannot go beyond the evidence, court is to confine
with the evidence available in the record only. So evidence available
in the record is that nothing had happened as stated in the FIR.

21. In view of above, it can be safely concluded that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused person as
required under the law.

22. Accordingly, the accused Motaleb Ali @ Abdul Motaleb is
acquitted of the offences charged u/s 8 of POCSO Act, 2012 and set
him at liberty forthwith.

23. The bail bond of the accused person is extended for
further period of another 6 (six) months u/s 437 (A) Cr.PC.C

24. A copy of this judgment be given to the _ District
Magistrate, Barpeta u/s 365 Cr.P.C.

26. Judgment is pronounced and delivered in the open Court
in presence of both the parties and | put my hand and seal of this Court
on this O8th day of January, 2020.
