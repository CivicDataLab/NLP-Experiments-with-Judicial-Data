UDGMENT

1. The prosecution case, in brief, is that, on 26.01.2018 one Somesh

Uddin lodged an FIR in Moinbari outpost alleging inter alia that on
23.01.2018 at about 6 pm while his 9 years old niece was returning from the
house of Soleman Ali of the same village accused restrained her on her way
and by pulling her to the bushes committed penetrating sexual assault on
her, but when she made hue and cry accused ran away. Hence the case.

2. Acting on the information police Moinbari outpost entered the same
in the general diary vide GDE No 417 dated 26.01.2019 and forw3arded the
same to Kalgachia PS. which registered a case being Kalgachia PS. case No.
61/18 u/s 4 of POCSO Act and S.l. Hazarat Ali Ahmed undertook
investigation. During the course of investigated police visited the place of
occurrence, recorded the statement of the witnesses, sent the victim girl for
medical examination, forwarded her to court for recording her statement u/s
164 Cr.PC.
Z

3. On completion of investigation, police finally laid the charge sheet
against accused Abbash Ali and Moynuddin u/s 6 of POCSO Act with a view
to stand trial.

4. In due course, when accused persons entered their appearance in
court, hearing the learned lawyers appearing for both sides and perusing
the materials available on record and after due compliance of section 207
Cr.P.C. vide order dated 08.05.2019 framed charges u/s 376(DB) IPC and 4
of POCSO Act. The substance of the offences on being read over and
explained accused pleaded not guilty and claim trial.

5. During the course of trial, the prosecution examined 3 witnesses
namely the informant Somesh Uddin as PW-1, the victim girl as PW-2 and
investigating officer as PW-3 respectively. However, considering the futility
of proceeding further with the case giving an opportunity of hearing to the
learned Addl. P.P. further prosecution evidence stands closed.

6. Examination of accused u/s 313 Cr.P.C. is also dispensed with in view
of lack of implicating materials. The plea of the accused is total denial of the
prosecution case. As such, on being asked accused declined to adduce
defence evidence.

7. Now point for determination ;-

.1. Whether on 23.01.2018 you in further hence of your common
intention committed gang penetrative sexual assault on the
victim girl (X) age about 9 years as alleged ?

.2. Whether on the same day and time you in further hence of your
common intention committed gang rape on the victim girl (X) age
about 9 years by force under the bushes and thereby committed
u/s 376(DB) IPC as alleged ?

8. Discussion, Decision and reasons for such decision :-

 

| have heard the learned lawyers appearing for both sides and also
carefully scanned the prosecution evidence available on record.

9. The learned counsel appearing for the State Smti. P. Das submitted
that three prosecution witnesses are examined by the prosecution, but
3

given the quality of their evidence it would be a futile exercise to go ahead
for recording evidence of other witnesses. Therefore, it is submitted that the
court may pass judgment after assessment of evidence of PW-1, PW-2 and
PW-3 on record.

10. On the other hand, learned defense counsel contended that in the
evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 nothing have emerged for sustaining conviction
of accused persons u/s 376 (DB) IPC and section 4 of POCSO Act as in the
course of their evidence. They pained a different picture for which accused
are clearly entitle to acquittal.

11. Having heard the rival contention and on perusal of the evidence of
PW-1 and PW-2 it appears that in their evidence PW-1 and PW-2 painted a
different picture as against the statements made by them in the FIR. PW-2
the victim girl also depose diametrically opposite evidence by saying that
whatever she stated before Magistrate u/s 164 Cr.PC. is totally under the
influence of others and no such incident had ever happened with her.

12. PW-1 also contrary to his allegation in the FIR depose in his evidence
that there was a quarrel with accused persons regarding not constructing
the house received by mother of the victim from government. Therefore,
after careful consideration of the entire evidence on record this court find no
reason to go ahead with further proceeding as it will serve no purpose other
then waste of valuable time and energy of court. None of PW-1 and PW-2
had stated anything in court to show that accused persons in further hence
of their common intention committed penetrating sexual assault on the
victim girl as alleged attracting punishment u/s 376(DB) IPC and section 4 of
POCSO Act 2012.

13. In the result, this court has no option but to acquit the accused
Abbash Ali and Moynuddin from the charges u/s 376(DB) IPC and Section 4
of POCSO Act on the ground of total lake of evidence and set them at liberty
forthwith.

14. The terms of bail bonds of accused persons are extended for a period
of 6 (six) months from to-day as provided U/S 437(A) of Cr.P.C.
4

15. Let a copy of the judgment be forwarded to the learned District
Magistrate, Barpeta as provided in section 365 Cr.P.C.

16. Let case record be consigned to record room as per procedure.

17. Given under my hand and seal of this Court on 21% day of June,
2019, at Barpeta.
