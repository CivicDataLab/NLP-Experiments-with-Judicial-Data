incident occurred. She stated that she filed this case against the

was living facility in the shop of accused which was alleged by the
informant that accused raped her daughter in his shop. Moreover, I.O.
of the case (PW6) did not find mental disorder of the victim at the time
of investigation. Thus 1.0. has contradicted the evidence of informant
and other witnesses that victim happened to be a mentally disorder
girl.

Moreover, victim has clearly stated in her evidence
that she does not know as to how she became pregnant.
Prosecution side has also not produced any material to show
that anybody saw the victim and accused in close or
compromising relation at any place to draw presumption
against accused that he raped the victim and made her
pregnant.

15). In the result, | am constrained to hold that the evidence
adduced by the prosecution in support of its case is nothing shorter
than mere conjectures and suspicion. Consequently, the charge under
Sections 376 of IPC read with Section 4 of the Protection of Children
from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 is held to be not proved against the

Special POCSO 34 of 2017 Page 10 of 12
accused Bulu Das beyond all reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the
accused is found entitled to get benefit of doubt, for which, the
accused Bulu Das is acquitted on benefit of doubt under
Section 376 of IPC read with Section 4 of the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

16). On scrutiny of the evidence on record, it is seen that no
case has been made out against the accused Bulu Das to warrant his
conviction under Section 376 IPC read with Section 4 of The Protection
of Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012 beyond all reasonable
doubt, for which, | am of the opinion that the accused is entitled to
acquittal on benefit of doubt, which | accordingly do.

17). In the result, accused Bulu Das is acquitted of the
charge under Section 376 IPC read with Section 4 of The Protection of
Children From Sexual Offences Act, 2012, levelled against him, on

benefit of doubt.

18). Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 25%
