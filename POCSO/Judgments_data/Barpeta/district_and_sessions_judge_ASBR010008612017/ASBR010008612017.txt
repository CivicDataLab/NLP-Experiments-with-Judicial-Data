11. The father of the victim Sukur Ali as PW4 has deposed that on
the day of occurrence, at about 2:00 PM he was at his own paddy field. He
could not find out his goat. He took the goat from the house of the
accused persons and gave his daughter to take home. Thereafter he left
the place. After some time, he heard that Abdul Haque, Sarap Ali, Abali
and wife of Sarap Ali physically assaulted his wife and daughter. He

has denied that he did not state before the police that while a boy

6

dagger to him and an amount of Rs.3000/- was missing from his kpocket.
He had admitted that he did not state before the police that Abalit

13. One Julhas Ali as PW6 has deposed that he heard that a

by the goat of the informant.

14. One Anowar Hussain as PW7 has deposed that relating to the
damage of paddy of the accused persons by the goat of the informant a
quarrel took place.

15. Sri Pradip Kr. Barman, the I/O of this case, as PW8 has
deposed that on 14.10.2016 the informant lodged the FIR and on
15.10.2016 he visited the place of occurrence. He sent the victim for
medical examination and also produced her before the magistrate for
recording her statement.

In cross examination he has stated that in the FIR names of 4
persons were mentioned as accused, but he could not collect any
evidence against accused Abali. He has stated that he did not produce the
victim for medical examination. The victim took treatment by herself. He
has stated that the victim did not state either in her statement u/s 161
CrPC or u/s 164 CrPC that accused Sarap Ali and Abdul Haque attempted
to cause illicit act with her. He has confirmed that PW Sukur Ali did not
state before him that he was informed by his son and then he came to the
place of occurrence and the accused persons showed dagger to him and
Snatched away an amount of Rs.3000/- from his pocket.

16. From the above discussions of the evidences of the
prosecution witnesses, it is found that though three independent
7

witnesses are examined as PW 5,6 & 7, but they did not support the
prosecution case. They simply stated that relating to the damage of paddy
of the accused persons by the goat of the informant, a quarrel took place
in between them. The informant has also not made a single whisper
regarding the attempt of sexual assault by the accused persons on the
victim. She has simply stated that the accused persons physically
assaulted the victim and her and the victim sustained injury on her back
and head. According to the victim, she sustained injury on her left leg. In
her examination-in-chief, she has stated that accused Abdul Haque and
Sarap Ali tried to commit sexual assault on her, but she has not made
such statement either under section 161 CrPC or under section 164 CrPC
and according to the FIR accused Abdul Haque tried to commit rape on
the victim. According to her, her father was not present at the time of
occurrence. He arrived at the place of occurrence while the occurrence
was over. But her father claimed himself as present at the time of
occurrence and according to him, he resisted the accused persons, but the
accused persons showed dagger to him and also snatched away an
amount of Rs.3,000/- from his pocket. According to him, the victim
sustained injury on her abdomen and right hand. He also does not state
that the accused persons tried to commit sexual assault on the victim.
The I/O has confirmed that this witness did not state before him that the
accused persons showed dagger to him and snatched away an amount of
Rs.3,000/- from his pocket. The snatching away of Rs.3,000/- from the
pocket of Sukur Ali i.e. PW4 is contradicted with the statement of the FIR.
According to the FIR, an amount of Rs.3,000/- was taken form the
informant Momtaz Khatun. Regarding injury, all the three witnesses have
contradicted each other. According to PW4, the victim sustained injury on
abdomen and right hand, according to the informant, the victim sustained
injury on back and head and according to the victim she sustained injury
on her left leg. But the medical officer did not find any injury on the
person of the victim. The victim only complained of pain of headache,
8

general weakness, back pain and leg pain. No weapon was used for those
complaints. Therefore, it is found that all the three witnesses i.e. PW2, 3 &
4, who are the victim and her mother and father, are the most interested
witnesses, but yet they have contradicted each other. PW2 and 4 i.e. the
mother and father of the victim have not made single whisper regarding
the sexual assault on the victim. Though the victim has stated in her
examination-in-chief as PW3, but she has not stated regarding sexual
assault in her statement either under section 161 CrPC or under section
164 CrPC. Hence, her evidence is not trustworthy and reliable. So, her
statement which is made in the court is not corroborated by any of the
witnesses, even her parents. So her evidence can not be relied upon and
on the basis of such unreliable and untrustworthy evidence, no one can be
convicted for any offence.
17. Under the above facts and circumstances, it is clear that the
prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of the accused persons for
any offence either under section 376 I.P.C or under section 12 of POCSO
Act, 2012. Therefore the accused persons are acquitted on benefit of
doubt and set at liberty.
18. Bail bond executed by the accused persons and the surety
are extended for another period of 6 (six) months from the date of this
judgment under section 437-A Cr.P.C.
19. Send copy of this Judgment and order to the Hon'ble Gauhati
High Court and also to the District Magistrate, Barpeta under section 365
Cr.P.C.
14. Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 2nd day
of July, 2018.
