JUDGMENT

1. Prosecution case in brief is that on 12.11.2017, Sri Kanai Biswas lodged
an FIR with Mayong Police Station alleging inter-alia that on 11.11.2017, at about 5:00
PM, while his minor daughter, the victim ‘X’ (name withheld) aged 12 years was
bringing back the cows from the field, the accused Bipul Biswas, with ill motive gagged
her mouth from the back side and took her to a little distance. On this, the victim made
hue and cry on which accused fled away from the place. Thereafter, hearing shouting
of the victim, two passerby Nirananda Das and Nabin Biswas rushed to the spot and
enquired the girl about the incident and handed over her to the informant.

2: On receipt of the FIR, Mayong PS Case No. 357/2017 u/s 12 of the
POCSO Act, 2012, was registered and investigated into. During investigation, the
statement of the victim was recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C and on completion of

Pocso Case No. 56/2018 Page 1 of 4
investigation, the Investigating Officer (i/o) submitted charge sheet against the
accused Sri Bipul Biswas for trial u/s 12 of the POCSO Act, 2012.

3. It may be mentioned herein that during investigation, the accused was
granted anticipatory bail on 19.01.2018. Upon receipt of summons, the accused
appeared before this Court on 21.01.2019, with a prayer to go on fresh bail which was
allowed.

4. On 24.09.2018, charge sheet was laid before this Court and vide order
dated 29.05.2019, charges u/s 8/18 of the POCSO Act, 2012 were framed and

explained to the accused to which he pleaded not guilty.

5. During trial, prosecution side has examined only two witnesses including
the informant and the victim. Considering the nature of the evidence, examination of
accused u/s 313 Cr.P.C is dispenses with and I proposed to dispose the case by using

powers u/s 232 Cr.P.C. without calling the accused to enter into defence.

6. I have heard argument of Id. Special P.P. Mr. A. Kalam and Mr. U. C.
Roy, learned defence Counsel and gone through the evidence on record. I have

considered the submission of both the sides.
POINTS FOR DETERMINATION ARE:

7. (i) Whether the accused has committed an offence punishable u/s 8/18 of
the POCSO Act?

DISCUSSION, DECISION AND REASONS THEREOF
8. PW-1, Sri Kanai Biswas, the father of the victim ‘X’ as well as the

informant of the case deposed in his evidence that, the victim ‘X’ is his daughter and

 

she was aged about 13 years at the time of incident. At present she is a student of
Class-X. On the date of the incident, at evening hours while he was at his shop,
Nirananda Das informed him that accused Bipul was assaulting the victim ‘xX’ in the
field. On this, he returned home and found that his daughter had returned from the
field. On being asked, she told him that the accused Bipul attempted to assault her,
she made hue and cry and on her cry, locals gathered there and recovered her.
Nirananda brought her to home. On the next day morning, he lodged an FIR at
Mayong Police Station by putting his thumb impression. In cross-examination, he
stated that the accused is his cousin. He cannot say about the contents of the FIR. On

the date of the incident, one of his cows entered into the field of accused and on
Pocso Case No. 56/2018 Page 2 of 4
damaging crops, there was altercation between the victim ‘X’ and the accused PW 1
admitted that they have compromised the matter with the accused and has no
objection in acquittal of the accused.

9. PW-2, the victim ‘Xx’ deposed in her evidence that she is presently aged
about 15 years and studying in Class-X. On 11.11.2017, at 6:00 PM, while she went to
field for bringing back cows, the accused attempted to assault her with a lathi on the
ground that their cow went to the field of the accused. On this, she made hue and cry
and on her cry, her uncle Nabin Biwas and Nirananda Das rescued her and bring her to
the house. After returning home, she informed the incident to her parents. Her father
filed a case against the accused. Police brought her to the Court for recording her
statement. Ext. 1 is the said statement and Ext. 1(i) and i(ii) are her signatures
thereon. In cross-examination, she stated that the accused is her uncle in relation.
Accused failed to assault her. Nabin Biswas was working in the field near to her. She
admitted that presently, they have compromised the matter with the accused and the
accused did not misbehave her.

10. From the above evidence on record, it appears that so far age of the
victim is concerned the victim and the informant claimed that at the time of incident,
the victim was aged about 13 years. This fact remained unrebutted during cross-
examination by defence.

11. From the evidence of the PW-2, the victim, it appears that except
attempt of assault, accused did not make any attempt to commit sexual assault upon
her. The victim clearly stated that on the date of incident, accused attempted to
assault her with a lathi on the ground that their cows went to the field of the accused.
PW-1, the father of the victim ‘X’ has corroborated this evidence of victim. PW 1
admitted the fact that on the date of the incident, one of his cows entered into the
field of accused and on damaging crops, there was altercation between the victim ‘xX’
and the accused. The victim categorically admitted that accused failed to assault her
and that he did not misbehaved her.

12. From the above evidence as discussed, it is clear that there is no
material whatsoever regarding any attempt of sexual assault by the accused upon the
victim ‘Xx’.

13. Considering above discussion, I am of the opinion that prosecution has

failed to prove the ingredients of charge u/s 8/18 of POCSO Act against the accused Sri

Pocso Case No. 56/2018 Page 3 of 4
Bipul Biswas. As such, accused Sri Bipul Biswas is acquitted from the charges u/s 8/18
of POCSO Act, 2012 and set at liberty forthwith.

14. The bail bond executed by accused and his surety are extended for

another six months from today u/s 437-A Cr.P.C.

15. Considering the nature of the case, the matter is not referred to DLSA

for granting compensation u/s 357-A Cr.P.C.

16. Send a copy of the judgment to learned District Magistrate, Morigaon
u/s 365 Cr.P.C.

17. Judgment is pronounced in open court. The case is disposed of on

contest.

Given under my hand & Seal of this Court on this the, 5" day of February, 2020

at Morigaon.
