PoddarSpecial Judge, Morigaon13.03.2020Accused Inamul Hoque and Ikramul Hussain @ Hoque have appeared before this court with two different petition for allowing them to go on bail.I have gone through the charge-sheet. On completion of investigation I.O has submitted charge-sheet against accused  Ikramul Hussain @ Hoque for trial u/s 363(A) IPC and against Inamul Hoque for the offence u/s 363(A)/376 IPC r/w section 4 of POCSO Act by showing both of them as absconder. Heard Ld. Advocate for both the sides on this bail petition. During hearing on the bail petition Ld. Advocate for the accused petitioners has submitted that on going through the statement of the victim recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C there was no single allegation against accused  Ikramul Hussain @ Hoque either on the point of kidnap or on the point of committing rape/ penetrative sexual assault on her. However, Ld. PP has submitted that in her statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C, the victim has implicated accused  Ikramul Hussain @ Hoque for the offence of kidnap and also protected the accused Inamul during the incident of rape on the victim which might attract charge of gang rape. It is also pointed out in her 164 Cr.P.C statement that the victim  that there  were three other boys in the vehicle in which she was kidnapped.  On reading  section 363(A) IPC it appears that this offence relates to kidnapping or maiming a minor for the purpose of begging but in this case the allegation is kidnapping of the minor girl for the purpose of seducing her for illicit intercourse. As such, prima facie it appears that the section 363(A) IPC should have been mentioned as 366(A) which would have been the appropriate section. Considering the statement of the victim given u/s 164 Cr.P.C statement, I am of the opinion that accused Md. Inamul Hoque deserve to be tried by remaining in custody atleast till recording the evidence of prime witnesses. However, due to non-increminating  Ikramul Hussain @ Hoque in her 164 Cr.P.C statement, I am of the opinion that he deserves to face the trial by remaining on bail. Considering this the prayer for bail of accused Inamul Hoque is rejected. He is remanded to judicial custody till 25.03.2020. However, accused  Ikramul Hussain @ Hoque is allowed to go on bail on execution of bond of Rs. 20000/- with one surety of like amount, i/d to jail custody till 25.03.2020.In the mean time copy branch is directed to made ready the copy of relevant papers.
