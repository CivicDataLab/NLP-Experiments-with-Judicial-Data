8. PW7 stated in his evidence that on the date of incident when he
reached paddy field to keep cattle he found a dead body. Later, he confirmed
that the dead body was belonged to his niece Ruksana Begum.
9. PW8 stated in her evidence that the accused wanted to marry her

12. PW11 Sri Kathiram Barman investigated the case and as he was
transferred to some other station charge sheet of the case was filed by SI Lal
Chand Sikdar.
13. The accused person denied the indictment.
14. Mr A.K.Miah learned advocate for the accused submits that PW6
Bachu Ali and PW8 Momina Bibi suspected accused's hands in the alleged
incident of murder of Ruksana Begum. PW6 is the father of the deceased
Ruksana Begum while PW8 is the elder sister of the deceased Ruksana
Begum. According to Mr Miah the evidence of PWs 6 and 8 are not sufficient
to hold the accused person guilty for the commission of such a heinous
offence.
15. On perusal of the evidence of PW6 it reveals that he stated to the

1.0. that he did not suspect anyone.
16. On careful examination of the evidence it is seen that the I.O.
roped the accused Mohibur Hoque with this case on the basis of oral evidence
of the witnesses related to the deceased. The I.O. did not search for any
corroborative evidence. During the course of evidence before this court it has
not been proved that the accused was in search of an opportunity to
take

revenge of Momina's refusal to marry him. If that be so and the petitioner was
scared of that the accused might cause problem to his family than why he did
not institute a village 'mel' so that the village would aware of the fact the
accused would get a lesson. Not a single incident has been brought before this
court to show that the accused was faced some to the deceased or the member
of the family of the informant. Our case is based on circumstantial evidence.
The circumstantial evidence must form a circle of truth. In our case the
evidence falls short to point the guilt of the accused. Since the prosecution has
not been able to bring a single circumstance to show that none but the accused
had committed rape on Ruksana Begum and thereafter killed her by
strangulation, accused person cannot be held guilty. Thus, the accused person
deserves benefit of doubt. Thus, the accused person is accordingly acquitted
and set at liberty forthwith.

Given under my hand and seal of this Court on this 16th day of
October/2015.
