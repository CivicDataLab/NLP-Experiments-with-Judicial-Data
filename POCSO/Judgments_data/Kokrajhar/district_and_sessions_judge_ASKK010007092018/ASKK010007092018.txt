POINTS FOR DETERMINATION :-

(i) Whether the accused is guilty of the offences under

341/342 IPC read with Section 8 of the POCSO Act?

DECISION AND REASONS :

6. Pw 1 xxx, is the victim. She deposed that the occurrence
took place about 6 months back. At about 3 p.m, she was talking to
accused Soleman Ali at road-side. At that time, her mother saw her

talking to the accused. Many people gathered as her mother reacted.

Thereafter, she was taken to police station. Local villagers also took the

accused to police station.

q; The learned Special P.P sought the leave of the Court to
cross-examine the victim as she had resiled from her previous stand.
After perusing the statement of the witness under Section 164 CrPC,

the leave was granted.

8. In cross-examination by the learned Special P.P, the victim
deposed that she had given a statement before the Magistrate wherein
she stated that while she was returning from School, the accused
called her filthy names. She also admitted that she stated before the

Magistrate that accused grabbed her and tried to remove her cloths.

9. In cross-examination by the defence, the victim deposed
that she gave the statement, under Section 164 CrPC, according to the
instructions given by the Police. Infact she was only talking to the
accused and that accused had not called her any names nor had he
grabbed her. She also deposed that her mother took her to Police

station at the instigation of villagers.

10. Pw 2, xxx, the mother of the victim deposed that she had
lodged the FIR in this case and that about 5 months back she was
informed by the villagers that her daughter is talking to accused. She
came to the place of occurrence and at the instigation of local people

lodged the FIR against the accused.

11. Pw 3 Abdul Khaleque deposed that about 6 months back

he had heard that some dispute took place between accused and the
4 eCourtis Copy
victim. He also deposed that he does not know anything else about the

occurrence.

12. Pw 4 Ayna Bibi and Pw 5 Jahura Bibi deposed that they do

not know anything about the occurrence.

13. So being the evidence on record, no materials for the
offences charged have been brought forth by the prosecution. The
evidence rather points towards mistake of fact. It would not be proper

to sustain a conviction on these evidence.

14. The point for determination is answered in negative.

ORDER

Accused Soleman Sheikh is acquitted of the charges under
Section 341/342 IPC read with Section 8 of the POCSO Act and set at

liberty forthwith.

His bail bonds shall remain valid for six months.

Given under the hand and seal of this Court on this 24" day of
